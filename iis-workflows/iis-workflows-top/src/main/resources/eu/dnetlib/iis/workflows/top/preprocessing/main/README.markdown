Fully functional preprocessing workflow including 3 phases:
* importing
* processing
* exporting

Processing phase consists of two independent processing paths:
* project reference extraction for WoS resources
* dataset and project reference extraction for all the other resources (PDF based: arxiv, puma, XML based: PMC, etc)

Exporting phase consists of three parts:
* inferred project and dataset references export
* WoS entities export for project reference extraction for WoS resources outcome
* dataset entities export for dataset reference extraction outcome
