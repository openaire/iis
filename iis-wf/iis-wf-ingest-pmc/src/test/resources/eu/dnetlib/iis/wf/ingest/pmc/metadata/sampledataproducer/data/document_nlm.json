Thirty-seven clones were selected, and their transcriptional start-sites were determined. The upstream sequence of these 37 start-sites, and the sequences of seven previously identified promoters were compared. On the basis of sequence conservation and mutational analysis, a consensus sequence CTTGACN<sub>16&#x02013;23</sub>TATNNT was obtained. In this consensus sequence, nine on of twelve bases are identical to the canonical <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter, however the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters only contain 6.4 conserved bases on average. We show that the <italic>R.etli</italic> sigma factor SigA recognizes all <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters studied in this work, and that <italic>E.coli</italic> RpoD is incapable of recognizing them. The comparison of the predicted structure of SigA with the known structure of RpoD indicated that regions 2.4 and 4.2, responsible for promoter recognition, are different only by a single amino acid, whereas the region 1 of SigA contains 72 extra residues, suggesting that the differences contained in this region could be related to the lax promoter recognition of SigA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNA polymerase holoenzyme consists of a core enzyme (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x02032;), and one sigma factor (&#x003c3;) subunit, which directs the core enzyme to specific sites on DNA to initiate transcription. In general, bacteria contain a main or housekeeping sigma factor, also known as sigma-70 (&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>) which controls the expression of most of the genes, in association with the RNApol core (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b1\">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b4\">4</xref>). Sequence alignments of several &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factors from different bacteria reveal four conserved regions (1 to 4), that have been further divided into subregions, involved in different aspects of transcription initiation, including promoter recognition, promoter melting, initiaton of RNA syntesis, abortive initiation and promoter escape (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b5\">5</xref>).</p><p>The &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> subunit of <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> recognizes two types of promoter sequences: the first one, or &#x02018;canonical promoter&#x02019;, consisting of two hexamer sequences [TTGACA] and [TATAAT], centered respectively in the positions &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 relative to the transcription start-site (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>). A helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif located in the C-terminus of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (subregion 4.2) recognizes the &#x02212;35 box of the promoter, whereas a more centrally located &#x003b1;-helix (subregion 2.4) recognizes the &#x02212;10 box (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b8\">8</xref>). The second one, named &#x02018;extended&#x02212;10 promoter&#x02019; consists of an element [TATAAT] plus 2 nt [TG], located in the &#x02212;15 and &#x02212;14 positions. In this promoter type a &#x02212;35 region or equivalent sequence does not exist. The N-terminal part of the subregion 3.0 (previously named 2.5) from &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is involved in the recognition of the conserved [TG] motif (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b9\">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b11\">11</xref>).</p><p><italic>Rhizobium etli</italic> is a soil &#x003b1;-proteobacterium with the ability to colonize the roots of bean-plants to form nitrogen fixing nodules. The whole genomic sequence of <italic>R.etli</italic> CFN42 was recently concluded [(<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b12\">12</xref>); GeneBank accession no CP000133], and consists of a circular chromosome and six large plasmids, with an average G + C content of 61.5%. <italic>R.etli</italic> contains a large number of sigma factors (one housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> gene, two copies of <italic>rpoH</italic>, two copies of <italic>rpoN</italic> and 18 genes of the extracitoplasmic factor group), a feature shared with other nitrogen fixing organisms, like <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic>, <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> and <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b4\">4</xref>). The physiological roles and the mechanisms of promoter recognition by these sigma factors remain unknown. Moreover, in these organisms only a few well-characterized promoters are available.</p><p>The <italic>R.etli</italic> housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> gene (<italic>sigA</italic>) encodes a protein of 685 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 77.18 kDa. The primary structure of SigA is very similar to RpoD (the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor of <italic>E.coli</italic>), especially in regions 2, 3 and 4, however SigA contains an extended region 1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13\">13</xref>).</p><p><italic>S.meliloti</italic>, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroide</italic>s also have a larger SigA region 1, and most of their &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters that have been characterized are not transcribed by the <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> RNApol <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>, but in contrast, the RNApol of these bacteria can initiate transcription of typical <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13\">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b16\">16</xref>). This observation suggests some differences between the transcriptional machineries of <italic>E.coli</italic> and the &#x003b1;-proteobacteria, perhaps at the level of promoter recognition by the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor.</p><p>The knowledge of the promoter structures and their regulation in a particular organism is the first step towards the molecular understanding of the regulatory networks, an essential prerequisite to develop tools for genetic engineering.</p><p>To analyze the molecular basis of <italic>R.etli</italic> gene expression in this study, we identified, characterized and sequenced active promoters in <italic>R.etli</italic> under exponential growth conditions. A consensus promoter sequence was deduced, and possesses some differences to the promoter consensus recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> in <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic>. We showed that the double helix stability and the stacking energy of the <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter regions possess a minimal energy value around &#x02212;10 box, suggesting that despite the differences in their promoter structures, the promoters of both bacteria preserve thermodynamic properties, which favor DNA denaturation and help the transcription initiation. We demonstrated that SigA specifically recognizes the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters studied in this work, but in contrast, the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNApol holoenzyme is incapable of recognizing them. Finally, we propose that <italic>R.etli</italic> contains a less strict &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> that recognizes a lax consensus promoter structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"materials|methods\"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl1\">Table 1</xref>. <italic>E.coli</italic> strains were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) medium. <italic>R.etli</italic> strains were grown at 30&#x000b0;C in PY medium (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b17\">17</xref>) or minimal medium containing 1.2 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.8 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM succinic acid, 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.0005% FeCl<sub>3</sub>, with the pH adjusted to 6.8 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b18\">18</xref>).

Briefly, DNA single chains (scDNA) were synthesized from 5 to 10 mg of total RNA using a gene-specific primer (GUS-LW5, CGATCCAGACTGAATGCCCAC) complementary to the region located in the position 96 to117 from <italic>gusA</italic>, and using a derivative of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLV RT). After first strand cDNA synthesis, the original mRNA template was removed by treatment with a RNase Mix (mixture of RNase H and RNase T1) and the scDNA was purified using a GlassMax DNA column. A homopolymeric tail was then added to the 3&#x02032; end of the scDNA using Terminal deoxynucleotidil transferase (TdT) and dCTP.

When secondary bands were obtained, an additional PCR was done using an AAP primer and a third antisense primer (GUS-LW2, GCTTGGCGTAATCATGGTCAT), that was complementary to the DNA region located in the position 1 to 21 from <italic>gusA</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequencing</title><p>DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the GUS-LW primers and Big-Dye terminator kit version 3.1 in an automatic 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of promoter mutations</title><p>Mutant versions of the p<italic>hemC</italic> and <italic>lac</italic> promoters were constructed by PCR using oligonucleotides carrying altered versions of the wild-type &#x02212;35, &#x02212;10 and both boxes simultaneously.

The induction in exponential growth phase (OD<sub>540</sub> = 0.4) was obtained by the addition of isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) up to the final concentration 1 mM. Cells were harvested after 4 h of cultivation and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. A total of 10 ml of culture usually yielded 2.5&#x02013;3 mg of protein. Histidine tagged sigma protein was purified using HisTrap Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer, containing 8 M urea and 0.25 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) [1&#x000d7; phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 20 mM imidazole], and incubated 30 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. After sedimentation of cell debris, lyzate was loaded on to Ni-column and equilibrated with a binding buffer. The desired protein was eluted by phosphate buffer, containing 400 mM imidazol, collected in 0.5 ml fractions, and analyzed in 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The applied procedure provides protein of 95% purity. To avoid the influence of six-aminoacide histidine tagg, HisTrap purified protein was treated by thrombin (Thrombin CleanCleave Kit, Sigma) after buffer exchange by dialysis. After the thrombin treatment protein was dialyzed against TGED buffer [10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.6); 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT; 0.1 M NaCl; 5% (v/v) glycerol] and storage buffer [10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.6); 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM DTT; 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.2 M KCl; 50% (v/v) glycerol]. The final concentration of protein was evaluated by method of Bradford (Bio-Rad protein assay kit).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding shift assay</title><p>Linear DNA templates were randomly labeled with [&#x003b1;-P<sup>32</sup>]dCTP in a standard PCR, purified from 3.5% PAGE and used for DNA&#x02013;protein complex formation.

Binary complexes were allowed to preform for 20 min at 30&#x000b0;C, challenged by heparin (200 mg/ml) and immediately loaded on to 3.5% native PAGE, prewarmed up to the same temperature. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and radioautographed.</p></sec><sec><title>Software tools</title><p>Multiple DNA alignments were done using the programs CLUSTALW version 1.8.1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b24\">24</xref>) and MultiAlin version 5.4.1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b25\">25</xref>). Alignments were visually inspected and adapted with respect to the known transcriptional start-sites. Consensus matrices were generated and selected using WCONSENSUS version v5c (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b26\">26</xref>). Briefly, to identify the &#x02212;10 box, the first 20 bp upstream from the transcription start-site (+1) were used. To identify the &#x02212;35 box, the 20 bp upstream to the &#x02212;20 position were used as an input for WCONSENSUS. Algorithms available from server <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/dna\"/> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b27\">27</xref>) were used to evaluate double helix stability (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b28\">28</xref>) and stacking energy (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b29\">29</xref>). Calculations for each parameter were carried out with a window size of 10 and 20 nt, providing similar results. For each promoter position, the average value was calculated for the whole set of analyzed sequences.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Isolation of <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter sequences</title><p>To determine the general structure of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters, a random genomic library with an average insert size of 0.5 kb was constructed in the promoter-test vector pBBMCS53 and introduced by conjugation into <italic>R.etli</italic> CFN42. Direct screening on PY plates containing X-Gluc allowed the selection of transconjugants with an active reporter gene (<italic>gusA</italic>), suggesting that the constructs contained <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter regions. The &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity of 100 transconjugans was determined in PY liquid cultures in exponential and stationary phases of growth. Sixty-eight of these clones showed &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity under both conditions, while the remaining 32 transconjugants expressed the reporter gene only in PY plates, and for this reason were not used in further experiments. The ability to express the reporter gene of the 68 strains described above was tested in different conditions: low oxygen (1%), minimal medium (MM) and at different temperatures (30, 42 or &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C). All but three expressed the reporter gene in all conditions, but at different levels, suggesting that the transconjugants carry constructs with constitutive promoters. The DNA sequences of 36 inserts of these constructs were determined. These promoter sequences, plus seven <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters experimentally identified in other studies were selected for subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b30\">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b35\">35</xref>).</p><p>Thirty-three promoters were mapped within intergenic regions; eight within the coding regions of the immediately preceeding gene, and three in DNA sections that contained overlapped coding regions.</p><p>The genetic compartments of the 44 promoters of our collection were next: thirty-nine were located on the chromosome, two on plasmid p42d and one in each of these plasmids: p42b, p42e and p42f.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of transcriptional start-sites</title><p>The transcription start-sites are good reference points to identify the upstream conserved sequence characteristics of the promoters. Thus, the 5&#x02032; ends of the mRNAs synthesized from each of the selected 36 promoter regions selected, were successfully identified by 5&#x02032; RACE using the total RNA isolated from PY cultures in exponential growth conditions of the transconjugants. In general, a single RT&#x02013;PCR product was obtained, but in one clone, two conspicuous amplification products were observed. In this case the bands were independently isolated, cloned and sequenced, showing that these products are transcripts associated to the same gene.</p><p>Thirty-eight of the transcription start-sites (86%) fell within the first 250 bp upstream from coding regions, and four transcription start-sites corresponded to the nucleotide A of the start codon ATG from their respective ORF (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl2\">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of a promoter consensus sequence</title><p>The promoter consensus sequence was derived by aligning 50 bp upstream from the transcription start-site of each promoter region. The identification of &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes was corroborated with the WCONSENSUS program as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1a</xref>, over-represented nucleotides clearly appeared around the &#x02212;35 region and, in a lesser degree, in the &#x02212;10 region. Then, the putative &#x02212;10 consensus box [TATNNT] showed four identical positions to the &#x02212;10 box of the <italic>E.coli</italic> consensus promoter [<underline>TAT</underline>AA<underline>T</underline>] recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor. The 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x02212;10 consensus boxes was positioned from 3 to 10 bp upstream from the transcriptional start-site (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1c</xref>). Six promoter regions (14%) showed the dinucleotide [TG] in positions &#x02212;15 and &#x02212;14, which resembled the structure of the <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x02212;10 extended promoter. The &#x02212;35 box consensus sequence [CTTGAC], is identical in five positions to the equivalent box of the <italic>E.coli</italic> consensus promoter [<underline>TTGAC</underline>A] recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. The spacing between the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 regions ranges from 16 to 23 bp (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1b</xref>). The promoter sequences contain 6.4 conserved bases on average, of the 12 conforming &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35.</p><p>Suboptimal promoters were identified in 11 of the 44 promoter regions as shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1a</xref>, but they were not taken in account to generate the consensus promoter sequence for the following reasons: none of them contained both hexameric boxes recognized by the best statistic parameters of WCONSENSUS. Nevertheless, in six of these promoters the &#x02212;35 box overlapped with one proposed by us. In one case the &#x02212;10 box overlapped the region proposed here. Moreover, some of the suboptimal promoters contained the spacer region two long (up to 27 bp) or to short (11 or 12 bp). In two cases the transcription start-sites were located far of the &#x02212;10 boxes (up to 20 bp).</p><p>The results presented here showed that the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter consensus possesses some similarities with the <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter consensus recognized by the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor, but the variability in the nucleotide frequency in each position of the consensus was greater than that observed in <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Thermodynamic properties of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter regions</title><p>It was recently demonstrated in several bacteria genomes, that the intergenic regions containing promoters are generally less stable and less flexible than coding regions (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b36\">36</xref>). To determine if these thermodynamic properties are also present in the promoter regions of <italic>R.etli</italic>, the stacking energy and the double helix stability were evaluated in our collection of 44 promoters. For this analysis the sequence of 200 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream from transcription start-site of all members of the promoter collection were taken in account. As an internal control, a set similar in size and length was constructed with the immediately downstream coding region of each member of the promoter collection. The same properties were predicted and contrasted with two <italic>E.coli</italic> equivalent sets: one containing 44 randomly chosen promoter sequences experimentally characterized and putatively recognized by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, and the other of 44 coding region sequences that corresponded to the genes controlled by the selected promoters. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a</xref>, the distribution profiles of double helix stability for coding and no coding regions of <italic>R.etli</italic> were similar, however, a significative local minimum around the &#x02212;10 element was detected in our collection of promoter regions. The average stability of the <italic>E.coli</italic> coding regions was higher than the average stability of their promoter regions, and like <italic>R.etli</italic>, a prominent feature of the promoter regions was a minimum stability around the &#x02212;10 box (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>The stacking energy profiles of <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter regions were variable, but with a tendency to low negative values (low stability), nevertheless local minimum values were located around the &#x02212;10 box. In contrast, the stacking energy profiles of <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> coding regions were similar: both showed more negative values that corresponded to great stability (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2a</xref> and b). These results suggest that despite the variability in the nucleotide composition of <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters, these regions possess thermodynamic and structural properties similar to the <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Promoter sequence mutagenesis</title><p>To demonstrate that the promoter consensus proposed here is correct, the DNA sequence of three <italic>R.etli</italic> mutant promoters (from <italic>repA</italic>, the antisense RNA gene present in the p42d <italic>repABC</italic> operon and <italic>recA</italic>) with the reduced transcriptional activity previously characterized was located in our alignment.

This promoter possessed five conserved positions from consensus and showed moderate activity. Three mutant derivatives were constructed that deviated the promoter sequence from the consensus. First, the putative &#x02212;35 element was altered, changing sequence [ATTGCG] to [A<underline>AGA</underline>CG] to generate the construct pGUSp<italic>hemC</italic>-35.

Third, the putative wild-type &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 elements were changed at the same time to the sequences indicated before, to generate plasmid pGUSp<italic>hemC</italic>-1035. These constructs were introduced into <italic>R.etli</italic> CFN42, and the &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activities of the transconjugants were determined. As shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3</xref>, all mutant constructs showed a low level of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity, indicating that the &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 elements of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter consensus were correctly identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity of the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters in <italic>E.coli</italic></title><p>As described in the previous section, the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter consensus sequence is more variable than that described for <italic>E.coli</italic>. This observation suggests that the <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is unable to recognize the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters or recognizes them less efficiently. To prove this possibility, the 36 transcriptional fusions of the collection were introduced into the BW21038 (<italic>gusA</italic>) strain, and their &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activities were evaluated in plates supplemented with X-Gluc. In this experiment only three promoters were functional, but showed low &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity. These results suggest that the 33 transcriptional fusions are poorly or unrecognized by the <italic>E.coli</italic> sigma factors. It is possible than the <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is incapable of binding the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters because it is more stringent in its recognition pattern, and imposes a strict functional barrier. If this hypothesis is true, then the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (SigA) activates the transcriptional fusions described above in <italic>E.coli</italic>.

In the promoter consensus sequences of <italic>C.crescentus</italic>, <italic>R.capsulatus</italic> and <italic>R.etli</italic>, the &#x02212;35 boxes are more conserved than the &#x02212;10 boxes (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the inspection of the all sequences showed that each bacterial species has a consensus sequence, with a different degree of variability. The <italic>R.etli</italic> and <italic>R.capsulatus</italic> promoters contain 6.4 and 5.0 conserved bases on average, respectively, less conserved in comparison with the promoter consensus of <italic>C.crescentus</italic>, that contains 8.0, <italic>E.coli</italic> 7.9 and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> 9.1 conserved nucleotides (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b40\">40</xref>). Finally, the number of conserved nucleotides, especially in the &#x02212;10 box, tends to diminish when genomic G + C content is above 60%. It is worth noting that the <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes are A + T rich and conserve 10 of 12 positions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>R.etli</italic> is a bacterium that inhabits diverse environments and has genome rich in genes related to transcriptional regulation, suggesting that it contains a complex genetic regulation system. To characterize the molecular basis of the transcription, and particulary, what kind of sequences act as promoters in <italic>R.etli</italic>, we identified and characterized a promoter consensus sequence recognized by the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor (SigA) in this paper.</p><p>The <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoter consensus sequence [CTTGAC] N<sub>16&#x02013;23</sub> [TATNNT] was deduced from 44 promoter regions. Using site-directed mutagenesis of one representative <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter isolated in this work, and a collection of mutants of three promoter regions described previously, we found that all changes fell within the &#x02212;10 or &#x02212;35 boxes identified in this work, suggesting that the consensus sequence is correct. Moreover, two different lines of evidence indicate that this promoter consensus sequence is recognized by the <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. The first one is that <italic>gusA</italic> fusions containing <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters are not functional in <italic>E.coli</italic>, but all regain their activity when complemented with SigA. Second, SigA is able to bind to the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters but not to their mutant derivatives that partially eliminate the &#x02212;35 or &#x02212;10 boxes.</p><p>The location of the 44 promoter regions in the <italic>R.etli</italic> genome showed that 33 are located within intergenic regions, and that 8 (18%), fall within coding regions. This situation has also been observed in other bacteria, i.e. in <italic>E.coli</italic> 18% of the promoters are within genes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b41\">41</xref>), and around of 20% in <italic>Prochlorococcus marinus</italic> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b42\">42</xref>).</p><p>Of the promoters 86% analyzed here were located less than 250 bp from the translation start codons of their genes. This property has been widely studied in <italic>E.coli</italic>, where it is known that 90% of the promoters are located less than 250 bp upstream from the gene that they regulate (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b41\">41</xref>).</p><p>Although the <italic>R.etli</italic>, <italic>B.subtilis</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter consensus display a common structure, the <italic>R.etli</italic> consensus sequence contains only 6.4 conserved bases on average, revealing a more variable composition than in the <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> consensus, where 7.9 and 9.1 nt are conserved on average, respectively (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b40\">40</xref>). Additionally, the <italic>R.etli</italic> promoter consensus shows that the sequence length between the &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes varies from 16 to 23 nt, nevertheless, 25 of the promoters (56.81%) present a distance of 17 &#x000b1; 1 nt. This variation range is similar to that found in <italic>E.coli</italic> (15 to 21 nt) and in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (14 to 20 nt). The percentage of promoters with 17 &#x000b1; 1 nt in length between the hexameric boxes, is quite low compared to <italic>E.coli</italic> (92%) and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (84.5%) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>). The distance between +1 nt and &#x02212;10 box 3&#x02032; end fluctuates from 3 to 10 bases, as found in <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>). Six promoters (14%) were found with a putative &#x02212;10 extended sequence, and their frequency is lower than those reported for this kind of promoter in <italic>E.coli</italic> (20%) and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (45%) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b43\">43</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b44\">44</xref>).</p><p>A computer analysis of DNA double helix stability and stacking energy showed that the promoter regions presented a minimum value for both parameters around &#x02212;10 box, as found in <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters. Having these results in mind, it is reasonable to conclude that in spite of their sequence heterogeneity, the promoter regions preserve thermodynamic properties which have been selected to favor DNA denaturation and help to start the transcription. Similar conclusions have been drawn for other bacterial promoter regions (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b45\">45</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>R.etli</italic> promoters tested are not recognized by <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, however, the <italic>E.coli lac</italic> promoter is recognized by <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, suggesting that <italic>R.etli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is more promiscuous than <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>.</p><p>The deduced primary structure of SigA is 47% similar to the <italic>E coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, especially in regions 2.4 and 4.2, which are responsible for promoter recognition. The most notable difference between SigA and RpoD is the larger size of region 1 of SigA, which contains 72 extra amino acids. This region could be related to the lax promoter recognition of SigA. Thus, <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> being the strictest factor for promoter recognition, it allows less structural variation, which is reflected in a robust consensus sequence. The opposite case is observed in &#x003b1;-proteobacteria, where the promiscuous &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> allows a larger variation in its promoter structure.</p><p>A promiscuous &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor could be an adaptive advantage for bacteria like the &#x003b1;-proteobacteria that inhabit environments with high biological and enviromental diversity, because they can take the benefits of the genetic information acquired by horizontal transfer in a fast and efficient way, avoiding a barrier that could limit the acquisition of new functions required for the adaptation to new environmental conditions.</p><p>Our comparison of the &#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1;&#x025a1; consensus of several bacteria suggests that differences in the genomic G + C content are related to promoter structure: the bacteria with high G + C content tend to be more variable, and to have &#x02212;10 boxes different in sequence to those from bacteria with low G + C content, and vice versa. Previous evidence in other organisms supports this conclusion (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b46\">46</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Marco Z&#x000fa;&#x000f1;iga, Rosa Elena G&#x000f3;mez Barreto, Ismael Hern&#x000e1;ndez, Patricia Bustos, Rosa Isela Santamar&#x000ed;a and Jos&#x000e9; Esp&#x000ed;ritu for their skillful technical support.
