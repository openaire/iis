<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper explores the power of personality traits both as predictors and as causes of academic and economic success, health, and criminal activity. Measured personality is interpreted as a construct derived from an economic model of preferences, constraints, and information. Evidence is reviewed about the "situational specificity" of personality traits and preferences. An extreme version of the situationist view claims that there are no stable personality traits or preference parameters that persons carry across different situations. Those who hold this view claim that personality psychology has little relevance for economics. The biological and evolutionary origins of personality traits are explored. Personality measurement systems and relationships among the measures used by psychologists are examined. The predictive power of personality measures is compared with the predictive power of measures of cognition captured by IQ and achievement tests. For many outcomes, personality measures are just as predictive as cognitive measures, even after controlling for family background and cognition. Moreover, standard measures of cognition are heavily influenced by personality traits and incentives. Measured personality traits are positively correlated over the life cycle. However, they are not fixed and can be altered by experience and investment. Intervention studies, along with studies in biology and neuroscience, establish a causal basis for the observed effect of personality traits on economic and social outcomes. Personality traits are more malleable over the life cycle compared to cognition, which becomes highly rank stable around age 10. Interventions that change personality are promising avenues for addressing poverty and disadvantage.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The power of cognitive ability in predicting social and economic success is well documented. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref>Economists, psychologists, and sociologists now actively examine determinants of social and economic success beyond those captured by cognitive ability. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> However, there remains a substantial imbalance in the scholarly and policy literatures in the emphasis placed on cognitive ability compared to other traits. This chapter aims to correct this imbalance. It considers how personality psychology informs economics and how economics can inform personality psychology.</p><p>A recent analysis of the Perry Preschool Program shows that traits other than those measured by IQ and achievement tests causally determine life outcomes. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> This experimental intervention enriched the early social and emotional environments of disadvantaged children ages 3 and 4 with subnormal IQs. It primarily focused on fostering the ability of participants to plan tasks, to execute their plans, and to review their work in social groups. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> In addition, it taught reading and math skills, although this was not its main focus. Both treatment and control group members were followed into their 40s. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows that, by age ten, treatment group mean IQs were the same as control group mean IQs. Many critics of early childhood programs seize on this and related evidence to dismiss the value of early intervention studies. 7 Yet on a variety of measures of socioeconomic achievement, the treatment group was far more successful than the control group. 8 The annual rate of return to the Perry Program was in the range 6-10% for boys and girls separately. 9 These rates of return are statistically significant and above the returns to the US stock market over the post-war period. 10 The intervention changed something other than IQ, and that something produced strong treatment effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]</ref> show that the personality traits of the participants were beneficially improved in a lasting way. 11 This chapter is about those traits. 7 See the Westinghouse study of Head Start <ref type="bibr">(Project Head Start [1969]</ref>). 8 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Heckman, Moon, Pinto et al. [2010a]</ref>. 9 See <ref type="bibr">Heckman, Moon, Pinto et al. [2010b]</ref>. 10 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">DeLong and Magin [2009]</ref> for estimates of the return on equity. 11 We discuss this evidence in Section 8. The traits changed were related to self-control and social behavior. Participants of both genders had better "externalizing behavior" while girls also had improved "internalizing behavior." See <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Duncan and Magnuson [2010b]</ref> offer a different interpretation of the traits changed by the Perry experiment, but both analyses agree that it was not a boost in IQ that improved the life outcomes of Perry treatment group members. Notes: IQ measured on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b528">(Terman and Merrill [1960]</ref>). Test was administered at program entry and each of the ages indicated.

[2006]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">Heckman and Masterov [2007]</ref> based on data provided by the High Scope Foundation.</p><p>Personality psychologists mainly focus on empirical associations between their measures of personality traits and a variety of life outcomes. Yet for policy purposes, it is important to know mechanisms of causation to explore the viability of alternative policies. 12 We use economic theory to formalize the insights of personality psychology and to craft models that are useful for exploring the causal mechanisms that are needed for policy analysis.</p><p>We interpret personality as a strategy function for responding to life situations. Personality traits, along with other influences, produce measured personality as the output of personality strategy functions. We discuss how psychologists use measurements of the performance of persons on tasks or in taking actions to identify personality traits and cognitive traits. We discuss fundamental identification problems that arise in applying their procedures to infer traits.</p><p>Many economists, especially behavioral economists, are not convinced about the predictive validity, stability, or causal status of economic preference parameters or personality traits. They believe, instead, that the constraints and incentives in situations almost entirely determine behavior. 13 This once popular, extreme situationist view is no longer generally accepted in psychology. Most psychologists now accept the notion of a stable personality as defined in this chapter. 14 Measured personality exhibits both stability and variation across situations. 15   Although personality traits are not merely situation-driven ephemera, they are also not set in stone. We present evidence that both cognitive and personality traits evolve over the life cycle-but at different rates at different stages. Recently developed economic models of parental and environmental investment in children help to explain the evolution of these traits. This chapter addresses the following specific questions, which we pose here and answer in the concluding section:</p><p>(1) How can we fit psychological constructs of personality into an economic framework? Can conventional models of preferences in economics characterize the main theories in personality psychology?</p><p>(2) What are the main measurement systems used in psychology for representing personality and personality traits, and how are they validated? How are different systems related to each other? 13 For an example of this point of view see <ref type="bibr" target="#b530">Thaler [2008]</ref>. 14 See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b381">Mischel and Shoda [1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">2008]</ref>. 15  <ref type="bibr">McAdams [2006, p.

Are interventions that change personality traits likely fruitful avenues for policy?</p><p>(8) Do the findings from psychology suggest that conventional economic theory should be enriched?</p><p>The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a definition of personality that captures central ideas in the literature on personality psychology. It also presents a brief history of personality psychology and the person-situation debate that paralyzed the field for 20 years and that still influences behavioral economics. Section 3 defines measured personality as a response function using an economic model of preferences, expectations, and constraints. Our model distinguishes measured personality from personality traits. We interpret personality as a response function mapping variables that characterize traits and situations to manifest (measured) personality. Our definition formalizes various definitions of personality used in the literature on personality psychology and facilitates the analysis of personality using the tools of economics. We also sketch a dynamic model of trait formation.</p><p>Section 4 discusses alternative criteria that psychologists use to define traits. It examines the strengths and limitations of each approach. We link our abstract definition to linear factor models that are commonly used to identify personality and cognitive traits.</p><p>Section 5 presents the main systems used to measure personality and cognition and discusses the relationship among the systems. We illustrate a nonidentification result developed in Section 3 by showing how scores on IQ tests are greatly affected by incentives and context.</p><p>We present additional evidence showing that the scores on achievement tests depend on cognitive and personality measurements, with a substantial predictive role for personality measures. Measures of "IQ" commonly used in economics and social science conflate measures of cognition and personality.</p><p>Section 6 discusses economic preferences and examines the evidence relating economic preference parameters to psychological parameters. Section 7 surveys the evidence on the predictive validity of personality measures for education, crime, health, and labor market outcomes. The material presented in the main text summarizes a large and growing empirical literature. A Web Appendix presents additional detail on the literature relating cognition and personality in each of these areas of economic and social life. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">16</ref>Section 8 presents evidence on the causal impact of personality on outcomes, as well as evidence on the stability and malleability of personality traits and preferences. We extend the theoretical framework for trait formation introduced in Section 3 and discuss a corresponding measurement system. We discuss the evidence from intervention studies. Section 9 concludes with provisional answers to the eight questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Personality and Personality Traits: Definitions and a Brief History of Personality Psychology</head><p>Personality psychology attempts to describe the whole person. 17 It considers both universal traits and individual differences. It examines the ways in which people are unique. As a sign of its breadth, personality psychology considers cognitive functioning as one aspect of personality.</p><p>In considering the content of personality psychology, it is helpful to distinguish personality traits, personality as a response function, and measured personality. Personality is a response function that maps personality traits to measured (manifest) personality.</p><p>One leading personality psychologist defines personality traits in the following way:</p><p>"Personality traits are the relatively enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that reflect the tendency to respond in certain ways under certain circumstances." <ref type="bibr">(Roberts [2009, p. 140]</ref>)</p><p>This definition, or closely related versions, are used throughout personality psychology. 18 We formalize these notions in Section 3.</p><p>Roberts' definition of personality traits refers to the stability of certain patterns of behavior-actions or responses to situations that people take, including patterns of thoughts or feelings. Perceptions, expectations of future events and preferences may shape behavior, feelings and thoughts. In this way, cognitive activities help to determine measured personality.</p><p>17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Cervone and Pervin [2009]</ref> provide a clear introduction to personality psychology. 18 However, some personality psychologists use this or a very similar definition to define personality and not personality traits. Thus <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Cervone and Pervin [2009]</ref> define personality as "psychological qualities that contribute to an individual's enduring and distinctive patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving" (p. 8). Another definition in a graduate text on personality by McAdams emphasizes context more strongly:</p><p>"Personality is a patterning of dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and integrative life stories set in culture and shaped by human nature" <ref type="bibr" target="#b353">McAdams [2006]</ref>. In this chapter, we define personality as a property of a system of equations and measured personality is the output of those equations.</p><p>There are many different models of personality. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">19</ref> A prototypical model that captures many features of a wide class of models in personality psychology is one due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b436">Roberts [2006]</ref>.</p><p>He presents the schematic displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> to relate personality traits to behavior. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">20</ref> He distinguishes mental abilities from personality traits (the items in the boxes will be discussed in later sections of this chapter). These, along with preferences (motives, interests, and values) and narratives (the stories people tell themselves in organizing their lives and making meanings of them), shape one's identity and reputation, including the views of the person by others and the person's perception of how others perceive him. Identity and reputation in turn shape the roles of individuals in the economy and the society and the larger culture to which they belong. Personality is the system of relationships that map traits and other determinants of behavior into measured actions.</p><p>In Roberts' vision of personality, feedback processes operate among all components of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Thus his broad conception of personality includes the possibility that identity shapes traits and abilities, perhaps through a mechanism such as epigenetics, in which environment affects gene expression. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">21</ref> Measured personality results from interactions among components of the system. Personality traits are one determinant of personality and need to be carefully distinguished from the full expression of personality, which is generated by the traits interacting with other factors. Personality is seen as a system of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that emerge from the interacting components. In Section 3, we formalize aspects of Roberts' framework for personality within an economic model of production, choice, and information. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> presages our discussion of a basic identification problem discussed in Section 3. Measurements and behaviors that arise from responses to incentives and interactions with culture are used to infer personality traits and abilities. Personality traits and cognitive abilities, along with the other "units of analysis" in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, produce the observed behaviors that are used to infer the generating traits. To infer traits from behaviors requires "parsing out" or standardizing for all of the other contributing factors that produce the observed behavior-a challenging task. The inability to parse and localize behaviors that depend on a single trait or ability gives rise to a fundamental identification problem. Behavior depends on incentives created by situations. Accurately measuring personality traits requires standardizing for situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.A. A Brief History of Personality Psychology 22</head><p>Interest in how individual behavior differs in common situations is as old as human history. The importance of personality traits for determining educational outcomes was recognized by the creators of the first IQ tests. Alfred Binet, architect of the first modern intelligence test that became the Stanford-Binet IQ test, noted that performance in school "...admits of other things than intelligence; to succeed in his studies, one must have qualities which depend on attention, will, and character; for example a certain docility, a regularity of habits, and especially continuity of effort. A child, even if intelligent, will learn little in class if he never listens, if he spends his time in playing tricks, in giggling, is playing truant." <ref type="bibr">(Binet [1916, p. 254])</ref> At about the same time that Binet was writing, Charles Spearman, best known for his work on " g "-a unitary factor that is claimed to capture the structure of intelligence-along with his student, Edward Webb, undertook studies of "character" because of "the urgency of its practical application to all the business of life" <ref type="bibr">(Webb [1915, p. 1]</ref>). Spearman and Webb concluded that many positive aspects of character shared a relation to what modern personality psychologists term "Conscientiousness." <ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">23</ref> This general factor, which Spearman and Webb chose to call "persistence of motives," meaning "consistency of action resulting from deliberate volition, or will," was distinct from a general intelligence factor <ref type="bibr">(Webb [1915, p. 60]</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">24</ref>Arthur Jensen, an intellectual heir of Spearman who is widely regarded as a proponent of g as an explanatory factor of success and failure in many domains of life, writes:</p><p>"What are the chief personality traits which, interacting with g , relate to individual differences in achievement and vocational success? The most universal personality trait is conscientiousness, that is, being responsible, dependable, caring, organized and persistent" <ref type="bibr">Jensen [1998, p. 575]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Pioneers of Personality Psychology</head><p>Over the past century, interest in personality among psychologists has fluctuated dramatically.</p><p>During the first half of the twentieth century, many of the most prominent psychologists (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Gordon Allport, Raymond Cattell, Hans Eysenck, Charles Spearman, Lewis Terman)</ref> were vigorously engaged in the study of individual differences in behaviors and traits. Psychologists studied personality traits along with intelligence, interests, and motivation and measured differences and similarities within and across individuals.</p><p>A systematic approach to the study of personality was conceived by early psychologists who believed that the most important dimensions on which human beings differed would be captured in natural language. These personality pioneers extracted words from the (English) dictionary that characterized individual differences between people (e.g., irritable, proud), after eliminating synonyms and words not associated with traits. They designed and administered studies of trait inventories to large samples of individuals and applied the same factor analytic methods developed by <ref type="bibr">Galton, Spearman, Binet, Pearson, Cattell, and</ref> Thorndike to these assessments in order to isolate " g " to identify the structure of cognitive abilities.</p><p>The fruits of several decades of research in this tradition beginning in the 1970s have produced a widely (but not universally) shared consensus taxonomy of traits, known as the Big Five, that is arrived at through factor analysis of observer and self-reports of behaviors. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">25</ref> The Big Five posits a hierarchical organization for personality traits, with five factors at the highest level and progressively more narrowly defined traits (or facets) at lower and lower levels. The tendency to be open to new aesthetic, cultural, or intellectual experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Conscientiousness</head><p>The tendency to be organized, responsible, and hardworking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Extraversion</head><p>An orientation of one's interests and energies toward the outer world of people and things rather than the inner world of subjective experience; characterized by positive affect and sociability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Agreeableness</head><p>The tendency to act in a cooperative, unselfish manner.</p><p>V. Neuroticism (Emotional Stability) Neuroticism is a chronic level of emotional instability and proneness to psychological distress. Emotional stability is predictability and consistency in emotional reactions, with absence of rapid mood changes.</p><p>* From the American Psychological Association Dictionary <ref type="bibr">[2007]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the Big Five traits. They are Openness to Experience (also called Intellect or Culture), Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (also called Emotional Stability). 26 The Big Five factors represent personality traits at the broadest level of abstraction. They summarize a large number of distinct, more specific, personality facets.</p><p>The Big Five are defined without reference to any context (i.e., situation). This practice gives rise to an identification problem that we discuss in Section 3. The behaviors used to measure the traits are also determined by factors other than the Big Five traits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b288">John [1990]</ref>,</p><p>Goldberg <ref type="bibr">[1993]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Costa and McCrae [1992a]</ref> present evidence that most of the variables used to assess personality traits in academic research in the field of personality psychology can be mapped into one or more of the dimensions of the Big Five. They argue that the Big Five are the longitude and latitude of personality traits, by which all more narrowly defined traits may be categorized (see also <ref type="bibr">Costa and McCrae [1992a]</ref>). We discuss the Big Five further in Section 5, where we also consider alternative measurement systems.</p><p>The Person-Situation Debate, Its Lingering Influence in Economics, and the Subsequent</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flourishing of Personality Psychology</head><p>In 1968, Walter Mischel published a monograph entitled Personality and Assessment, challenging the most important theoretical assumptions and empirical findings of personality psychology. An acrimonious "person-situation" debate ensued, which pitted those who favored situational factors as explaining behavior against those who considered personality traits as more consequential. During this time, considered by many to be a dark age in the history of personality psychology, the general Zeitgeist favored experimental social psychological approaches which focused on the importance of the situation compared to the individual traits featured in personality psychology.</p><p>Mischel noted that correlations between behavioral task measures of personality and questionnaire measures seldom, if ever, exceeded 0.3. 27,28 The implication of such withinindividual behavioral heterogeneity suggested to Mischel that "the behaviors which are often construed as stable personality trait indicators are highly specific and depend on the details of the evoking situations and the response mode employed to measure them" (p. 37). Mischel wrote "…with the possible exception of intelligence, highly generalized behavioral consistencies have not been demonstrated, and the concept of personality traits as broad dispositions is thus untenable" - <ref type="bibr">Mischel [1968, p. 146]</ref> Mischel went on to write that global (i.e., domain-general) traits (e.g., "impulsive", "confident") measured in one situation did not predict future behavior and outcomes in other situations. His view was that global traits, in attempting to summarize behavioral dispositions without regard to situational contingencies, were "excessively crude, gross units to encompass adequately the extraordinary complexity and subtlety of the discriminations that people constantly make" (p.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>301).</head><p>Mischel now suggests <ref type="bibr">[2004]</ref> that behaviors can be consistent across time, but that the locus of consistency is to be found in highly contextualized if-situation/then-behavior contingencies (e.g., "If I feel threatened, then I am aggressive"). Variance across situations was, 27 There is great irony in the fact that none of the correlations of cognitive measures with outcomes that are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">A1</ref> in the Web Appendix are as high as 0.3, but no one questions the power of cognition in predicting outcomes in social life. Few studies in social psychology show correlations as high as 0.2 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b433">Richard, Bond and Stokes-Zoota [2003]</ref>). 28 Psychologists often work with standardized variables (variables normalized by standard deviations). They report correlations between standardized variables as "effect sizes."</p><p>Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 20 in Mischel's view, improperly treated by most personality psychologists as "error." 29 Indeed, in his view, the systematic variation of behavior across situations points to underlying motivations, beliefs, schemas, strategies, and other factors that collectively and interactively give rise to coherence in any individual's measured personality. His revised view of personality is broadly consistent with Robert's Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>In Section 3, we formalize the "if-then" relationship using an economic model. We show that the person-situation debate boils down to an empirical question about the relative importance of person, situation, and their interaction in explaining behaviors. Although Mischel may have intended otherwise, proponents of the situationist view have used his monograph as ammunition in the battle against accepting evidence from personality psychology into economics. Like most heated debates in social science, this one occurred in the absence of much data. In Section 5, we discuss the body of evidence that has emerged over the past four decades on the existence of stable personality traits.</p><p>The debate over the relative importance of person and situation in the 1960s and 1970s reflected deeper currents in psychology and social science more generally, that still run strong.</p><p>Behaviorism, associated with B. F. Skinner was influential. It posited that experience explains all aspects of behavior. There was the widely held notion that situation and experience were all powerful-that people were born as blank slates. 30 This captured the interventionist spirit of the times. Inter-individual heterogeneity in traits was ignored. <ref type="bibr" target="#b458">Ross and Nisbett [1991]</ref> summarize the position of many social psychologists:</p><p>29 I.e., unobserved heterogeneity. 30 Pinker <ref type="bibr">[2002]</ref>.</p><p>"Manipulations of the immediate social situation can overwhelm in importance the type of individual differences in personal traits or dispositions that people normally think of as being determinative of social behavior" (p. xiv).</p><p>Many behavioral economists hold a similar view and they often appeal to Mischel as a guiding influence. For example, in a recent round table discussion, Richard Thaler noted that "The great contribution to psychology by <ref type="bibr">Walter Mischel [...]</ref> is to show that there is no such thing as a stable personality trait" <ref type="bibr" target="#b530">(Thaler [2008]</ref>).</p><p>Many studies in behavioral economics attempt to establish inconsistency in behavior across situations, in violation of standard assumptions of stable preferences used in mainstream economics. For instance, several studies find very low correlations in risk-taking behavior across situations. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">31</ref>Personality psychology survived the Behaviorist assault and is a prospering field. A rich body of correlational evidence, which we summarize in Section 7, shows that for many outcomes, measured personality traits are as predictive, and are sometimes more predictive than standard measures of cognition, that traits are stable across situations, and situations also matter.</p><p>Mounting evidence that behavior has a biological basis suggests that personality is an important determinant of behavior. The evidence from behavioral genetics shows that measured personality traits are as heritable as cognitive traits. Studies in neuroscience show that alterations in brain structure and function through accidents, disease and by experiments affect measured personality. They reinforce the evidence from heritability studies. This evidence and other evidence shows that something about measured personality is real. We review this evidence in Section 8.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Models</head><p>Personality psychologists rarely use formal models to define or measure their constructs. In order to introduce their knowledge to economists, we formalize their frameworks. Doing so makes the concepts of personality psychology more precise and provides a basis for measurement and policy analysis.</p><p>We introduce a series of progressively more comprehensive models to integrate concepts from personality psychology into economics. 32 Roberts' framework (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) captures the main features of the influential models used in personality psychology. We use it as a point of departure. Psychology adds new and often more nuanced descriptions of human behavior to the standard descriptions used in economics.</p><p>In the nineteenth century, economics and psychology were closely aligned. Economists then spoke of the "hedonic calculus" used by people weighing choices. 33 One of the advances made in neoclassical economics in the first half of the twentieth century was to focus on choices and the objective (easily measured) factors (like prices and incomes) that determine choices.</p><p>Revealed preference became a central tool of economics and was implemented using the marginal rate of substitution between choices-a key parameter that emerged from the neoclassical revolution. 34 This parameter did not require measurable utility or knowledge of the 32 Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] develop a variety of economic models for integrating personality psychology into economic models. We build on their analysis. We review these frameworks in Section A3 of the Web Appendix. 33 See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b488">Schumpeter [1954]</ref>. 34 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">Hicks [1946]</ref>.</p><p>mental states of the agents making choices. Mental states and measureable utility, once the province of economists, were eliminated by Occam's Razor.</p><p>Measurable utility was used in utilitarian economics but fell out of favor (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b474">Samuelson [1956]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Foster and Sen [1997]</ref>). Preferences that fulfilled criteria for rationality were consistent with utility functions that were determined up to monotonic transformations. Measurable utility returned in a specific fashion with analyses of decision-making under uncertainty (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b476">Savage [1954]</ref>).</p><p>Most economists view mental states as unnecessary baggage except insofar as they affect choices. Thus, the traits, abilities, and narratives used by Roberts in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> are of interest to most economists only if they affect choices through preferences, constraints, and effects on information processing capabilities. Motives and values are captured in part by economic preference parameters. Until recently, "happiness," and "aggregate utility," as well as other subjective mental states that do not affect behavior (choices) were considered uninteresting to most economists. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_14">35</ref>Preferences, constraints, and expectations provide the most direct way to introduce psychological variables into economic models. We begin our analysis with a barebones approach that focuses on constraints. For example, cognitive and personality traits affect earnings capacity because they enhance productivity (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bowles, Gintis and Osborne [2001a]</ref>), and, at least up to a point, more of a trait can generate more resources which enlarge choice sets and hence directly affect behavior.</p></div>

Indeed, as discussed in Section 5, certain psychopathologies are associated with extreme levels of traits that are quite productive at normal levels. Different traits may have different productivities in different tasks, leading to comparative advantage in different tasks for people with different endowments. 37</p><p>Efforts may complement traits 2 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">j j e               </formula><p>or may substitute for them 2 0 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">j j e               </formula><p>A variety of intermediate cases might exist where some effort-trait relationships are complementary and others are substitution relationships.

The choice of effort depends on the pattern of complementarity and substitutability. Different situations may be associated with different rewards for the same task. Such variation can produce differences in performance across tasks of the sort featured in the person-situation debate discussed in Section 2. One needs to standardize for the incentives to exert effort across tasks and differences in the endowments of effort in order to use measurements of performance on tasks to identify traits,  .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.C. Identifying Personality Traits</head><p>Before considering more general models, it is useful to discuss basic identification problems that arise in simple settings and that also arise in more general models. At the current level of generality, all traits can potentially affect productivity in all tasks. However, some tasks may 42 The first order conditions for this problem are standard:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">     j j j R e</formula><p>, and 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">j e  , 1, , j J  </formula><p>, where  is the vector of multipliers associated with the effort constraint. Some people may allocate no effort in some tasks. j P may be zero if 0 j e  , but this is not strictly required. Again, it is straightforward to generalize this reward function to a general utility function   1 , , J U P P  .</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">43 2 0 j j e       </formula><p>is a force toward devoting more effort to task j . If effort is complementary with traits in all tasks, as traits expand, more effort will be expended in those tasks that are relatively more complementary in effort.</p><p>require only a single trait or a subset of all of the traits. Following a traditional dichotomy in psychology that is explicit in Roberts' Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, divide  into "mental,"  , and "personality,"</p><p> , traits:   and   , each of which may in turn be a vector. 45   Psychological measurement systems sometimes use productivity measured in different tasks to identify   and   . 46 This is the way <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Carroll [1993]</ref> defines mental ability where the task is performance on "mental" tests. To use performance on a task (or on multiple measures of the task) to identify a trait requires that performance on certain tasks (performance on a test, performance in an interpersonal situation, etc.) depends exclusively on one component of  , say , to use j P to identify a measure of the trait that is uniform across different situations that elicit different levels of effort. 47   The activity of picking a task (or a collection of tasks) to measure a particular trait ( 1, j  in our example) is called operationalization in psychology. Construct validity refers to whether or not a purported measure of the trait constructed in the stage of operationalization correlates 45 Effort endowment might also be divided in the same fashion  </p><p>, e e  </p><p>, but we do not explicitly develop this possibility. 46 They also use observer reports and tests which can be interpreted as observation on performance of tasks and psychometric tasks. 47 A weaker notion is to achieve relative ranks of a trait. One can define the rank of a trait holding fixed the ranks of all other influences.</p><p>Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 29 with measures deemed to represent the trait. Considerable judgment is required to operationalize a trait and independently validate it. There is clear danger of circularity. Economists should carefully scrutinize how the measures they borrow from psychology are operationalized and validated in that literature. We should not necessarily assume that the measures created in that field have been rigorously established. We discuss how major constructs are validated in Section 5.</p><p>Assuming that construct validity has been established, if effort is involved in the performance of a task used to uniquely define a trait, the measurement of performance must be standardized in order to use measured productivity j P to identify the trait. Otherwise, the endowment of effort, and all of the factors that contribute to the exertion of effort, including the reward to the task, j R , will contaminate the estimate of the trait. Failure to adjust for effort produces the kind of variability across situations with different rewards that was much discussed in the person-situation debate. We present examples of such contamination of measurement by the operation of incentives on effort in Section 5.</p><p>Operationalization and construct validation clearly require heroic assumptions. Even if one adjusts for effort in a task, and thus adjusts for situational specificity, productivity in a task may depend on multiple traits. Thus two components of  (say 1,  , 1,  ) may determine productivity in task j . Without further information, one cannot infer which of the two traits produces the productivity in j . But in general, even having two (or more) measures of productivity that depend on  </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">1, 1, ,    </formula><p>is not enough to identify the separate components.</p><p>Consider the following case of two productivity measurements on tasks j and j : ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">    1, 1<label>, 1, 1, , , , , , .</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">    at e  . 49</formula><p>The rank condition might not be satisfied, and the functional forms j  and j   might not be known. The productivity functions need not be monotone in 1,</p><p> or 1,  . Interacting systems might produce multiple equilibria so that the same values of  produce different values of ( , ) j j P P  . 50 Interacting systems might also have no solution.</p><p>Note that even if these problems do not arise, only the pair  </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">1, 1, ,    </formula><p>is identified. One cannot (without further information) determine which component of the pair is 1,  or 1,  . In Section 5, we present an example where scores on achievement tests depend on both IQ and personality traits. In the absence of dedicated constructs (constructs that are generated by only one component of  ), an intrinsic identification problem arises in using measures of productivity 48 Note that if the support of j e and j e  is disjoint, no e  exists and so no such standardization is possible.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">49 Let         1, 1, ,</formula><p>.

For example, one might be able to choose configurations of data with low (or zero) values of one component. At high levels of effort, induced by a change in the reward, the effect of one component on productivity might vanish, etc. 52 This problem arises in linear factor models, but it is a more general problem. See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Anderson and Rubin [1956]</ref> for a definitive treatment of linear factor models. The scales in any factor model are arbitrary and are always defined with respect to a normalization (i.e. a dedicated measurement that defines the factor).

Another simple extension of the model is the case where there is no financial gain from engaging in tasks, but the agent receives a direct utility benefit from doing so.

Colloquially, "there are many ways to skin a cat," and the choice of which way to do so in any task defines the action taken.</p><p>To capture these more general notions, we introduce the concept of "actions" that are broader than what is captured by e. Actions are styles of behavior that affect how tasks are accomplished.

For example, a naturally gregarious person may find it easier to engage in social interactions than others. Stated this way, actions generalize the notion of effort to a broader class of behavior. Analytically, they play the same role as effort, and some actions may be components of effort. There may be utility costs or benefits of effort exerted. A special case arises when there are increasing returns to effort in each action. In that case, the agent will simply apply all of his effort j e in task j to the action which gives him the highest productivity, and the other possible actions are not taken.</p><p>Agents may have utility over actions beyond the utility derived from consuming the outputs of tasks. For example, an agent may prefer accomplishing a task by working hard rather than by cheating. Different beliefs, thoughts, and feelings may have different effects on outcomes. Introducing actions in this fashion allows for the possibility that some actions are valued in their own right and do not directly contribute to productivity in any of the J tasks.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.H. Life Cycle Dynamics</head><p>The analysis in the preceding subsection was for a particular point in time (e.g., a period). Traits are not set in stone. In a dynamic setting, one can think of traits, T , information,  , situations, h , and actions, a , as state variables that evolve through aging, experience, and investment. As a result of experience (including social interactions), situations, biology (ontogeny), and investment, traits may change over the life cycle. We briefly discuss the dynamics of trait and state formation, leaving a more complete discussion to Section 8.</p><p>To capture the evidence from a large and growing literature, we consider the dynamic evolution of traits.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_19">foot_19</ref> Let v T be traits at age v ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">  1, , v V   </formula><p> . Traits may change through family and self investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Cunha and Heckman [2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">2009]</ref>), through schooling, through biology or through experience. Information v  may be updated through various channels of learning. All task outputs, actions and goods inputs may be time dated.</p><p>Investment in period v is an action or set of actions that an individual (or a person or group acting for the individual) may take in period v. Investments have dynamic effects. The technology of skill formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Cunha and Heckman [2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">2009]</ref>) captures the notion that traits may evolve in response to the inputs of a vector of investments (IN v ), and through aspects of the situation in which the agent is found, v h , where v h is the vector of attributes of the situation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">(16)   1 self-productivity investment ( , , ) , 0 , , 1 v v v v v T T I N h v V      </formula><p>where the first set of arguments arises from self and cross productivity (skill begets skill; traits beget other traits and traits cross-foster each other; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Cunha and Heckman [2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">2009]</ref>). The second set of arguments arises from investment. Investment is a broad concept and includes parental nurturance, schooling, learning by doing, and learning by imitation, etc. The third set of arguments arises from the situation in which the person is placed. 71   Notice that if elements of v T are augmented over the life cycle through investment and practice, the actions and efforts required to achieve a given task can change. Thus, if , v  is enhanced over time, the amount of effort required to perform a task may be reduced. In this way, we can model habit formation and capture the notion of arete, effortless performance of actions, discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Aristotle [1956]</ref>. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_20">72</ref>As emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b381">Mischel and Shoda [1995]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b444">Roberts and Jackson [2008]</ref>, situations may change over time as a function of past actions, past situations, investment, information, and the like. We present this possibility by the following equation of motion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">(17)   1 , , . v v v v v h h I N a   </formula><p>Past actions may serve to determine the set of present situations.

Thus people may learn about their environments and themselves in part as a consequence of their own actions and in part as a consequence of the exogenous arrival of information. Equations of motion ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) are very general. We consider special cases of them used in the empirical literature in Section 8.</p><p>A rich and evolving literature investigates dynamic preferences when agents do not possess full knowledge of their future environments (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Hansen [2005]</ref>, Hansen</p><p>and Sargent <ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b464">Rust [2008]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Epstein and Zin [1989]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Epstein and Schneider [2003]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b499">Skiadas [1998]</ref>). That literature is too large to summarize in this paper. Preferences need not be separable over time, and there may be time inconsistency of choices associated with hyperbolic discounting. 73 We discuss commonly used dynamic preference specifications in Section 6. Thus, a restricted version of (17) formalizes aspects of the Five Factor Theory. The theory features "characteristic adaptations," which correspond to the actions and efforts of our model that also affect the productivity in tasks. The role of preferences is left unspecified.</p></div>

Traits evolve through biological processes (ontogeny), but investment or experience do not affect the evolution of traits. Thus, the arguments of equation ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) are shut down, but traits may still exogenously evolve as a function of age and the biology of the individual. Even though traits evolve as part of an exogeneous maturation process, persons may learn about themselves (their traits) by taking actions and by being acted on by the external environment. In that version, agent behavior is entirely shaped by situations. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b382">Mischel and Shoda [2008]</ref> focus on the role of situation in shaping actions, efforts, and productivities, but also allow for traits to influence actions. The "sociogenomic" model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b444">Roberts and Jackson [2008]</ref> also considers the dynamics of personality formation.</p><p>Thus, both schools of thought accept specification (9) or its extension (10), and both would be comfortable with response systems ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">15</ref>). The relative importance of the factors emphasized by the two schools of thought can only be settled by empirical research. The socialcognitive theorists tolerate deviations from rationality in their theories, while trait theorists typically do not.</p><p>Both schools of thought entertain the possibility of learning about oneself. A major difference between the two groups comes in the role of investment in producing traits. The social-cognitive theorists feature investment and social interactions as direct determinants of traits that are assumed to evolve as a function of the experiences of agents. The trait theorists do not consider this possibility. Instead they emphasize self-learning about traits that evolve by fixed biological principles unrelated to the experiences of individuals. 75</p></div>

This leads directly to the analysis of latent variables and to factor models that underlie much of the analysis of trait psychology.

Discriminant and Convergent Validity</head><p>In this simplified framework, most personality psychologists focus on observer-and self-reports as measures of , n j P . The measurements are designed to capture a particular trait. As discussed in Section 3, the choice of which collection of tasks is used to measure a capability ("operationalization and construct validity") is an inherently subjective activity. Many psychologists take a pragmatic, empirical point of view. Traits are what the measurements used 77 The strength of the correlation depends on the magnitudes of j  and j   across the two tasks, j and j . 78 Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] present a nonparametric identification analysis for a general nonseparable model allowing for measurement error in measures of performance. In the notation of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">19</ref>), they nonparametrically identify the distribution of n T and the distribution of , n j  , , , 1 j J   , the latter without assuming full independence among the measurement errors.</p><p>capture. 79 The danger with this empiricist definition is that it offers no guide to the choice of measurements, which are usually settled by conventions or intuitions.</p><p>The concept of "discriminant validity" of a collection of tasks (e.g., a set of test scores or a set of observer reports or measurements of productivities) is commonly used to test for construct validity. This approach exploits the notion that a particular battery of measurements captures a component of n T , for example, , n l T , and not other components. Many measurements may be taken on , n l T , and having multiple measurements helps to control for measurement error.</p><p>All measurements are really just outcomes on a type of task although the effort applied may vary greatly across tasks. The literature in psychology usually assigns a special status to tests, self-reports, and observer-reports of latent traits, but also uses direct measures of productivity, such as supervisor ratings. 80 Behaviors, tests, observer reports, and self reports all can be used to proxy the underlying traits. These include repeated measurements on the same types of assessment mechanisms as well as measurements on different behaviors and assessments that are assumed to be generated by common traits. 81   A standard approach to defining constructs in personality psychology is based on factor analysis. This approach takes a set of measurements that are designed to capture a construct, and measures within-cluster and across-cluster correlations of the measurements to isolate latent factors , , 1, , n l l T L   or their distributions. The measurements and clusters of tests are selected on intuitive grounds or a priori grounds, and not on the basis of any predictive validity in terms of real-world outcomes (for example, success in college, performance on the job, earnings). This 79 Borsboom, Mellenbergh and van Heerden [2003] compare the approach taken in Section 3 of defining traits a priori within a model with the operationalist approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Bridgman [1959]</ref>) of defining a trait by whatever measurements are available on it. Operationalism begs the question of operationalization and construct validity. 80 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Groth-Marnat [2009]</ref>. 81 Different measurements may load onto different traits.</p><p>process gave rise to the taxonomy of traits that became the Big Five. Because of the somewhat arbitrary basis of these taxonomies, there is some controversy in psychology about competing construct systems which we discuss in Section 5. In practice, as we document below, the requirement of independence of the latent factors across constructs (lack of correlation of tests across clusters) is not easily satisfied. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_22">82</ref> This fuels controversy among psychologists advocating competing taxonomies.</p><p>To state these issues more formally, let , q n l P be the q th measurement on trait l for person n .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.C. Predictive Validity</head><p>An alternative criterion for validating measurement systems is based on the predictive power of the tests for real world outcomes, that is, on behaviors measured outside of the exam room or observer system. The Hogan Personality Inventory, 88 the California Personality Inventory, and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were all developed with the specific purpose of 84 Hansen, <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Heckman and Mullen [2004]</ref> show how to allow n Q to depend on l T and still identify the model 85 This is sometimes weakened to a condition of zero correlation. 86 Cronbach's alpha is a widely used measure of intercorrelation among test scores, that is, a measure of importance of the variance of the , q n l  uniquenesses relative to the variance of the factors. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">Hogan, Hogan and Roberts [1996]</ref> for a precise definition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b498">Sijtsma [2009]</ref> discusses the severe limitations of Cronbach's alpha. 87 Nothing in these standard testing procedures guarantees that the measurements that satisfy convergent and discriminant validity identify a single trait. Multiple traits operating in the same fashion across many outcomes would produce outcomes and factors that satisfy the criteria. The multiple traits would be captured into a single factor. Only if different traits differentially affect different outcomes can one identify different traits. 88 See <ref type="url" target="http://www.hoganassessments.com/products_services/hpi.aspx">http://www.hoganassessments.com/products_services/hpi.aspx</ref> and also <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Hogan and Roberts [2001]</ref>.</p><p>predicting real-world outcomes. Decisions to retain or drop items during the development of these inventories were based, at least in part, upon the ability of items to predict such outcomes.</p><p>This approach has an appealing concreteness about it. Instead of relying on abstract a priori notions about domains of personality and subjectively defined latent factors generated from test scores and self and observer personality assessments, it anchors measurements in tangible, realworld outcomes and constructs explicit tests with predictive power. Yet this approach has its own problems.</p><p>First, all measurements of factor , n l T can claim incremental predictive validity as long as each measurement is subject to error   , 0 q n l   . Proxies for , n l T can appear to be separate determinants (or "causes") instead of surrogates for an underlying one-dimensional construct or factor. Thus suppose that measurement system (20) is the correct specification and that a set of measurements display both convergent and discriminant validity. As long as there are measurement errors for construct l , there is no limit to the number of proxies for , n l T that will show up as statistically significant predictors of an outcome. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_24">89</ref> For this reason, it is necessary to correct for measurement error in using predictive validity to identify and measure traits.</p><p>A second problem with this approach to validation is reverse causality. This is especially problematic when interpreting correlations between personality measurements and outcomes.</p><p>Outcomes may influence personality measures as well as the other way around. For example, self-esteem might increase income, and income might increase self-esteem. Measuring personality traits prior to measuring predicted outcomes does not necessarily solve this problem.</p><p>For example, the anticipation of a future pay raise may increase present self-esteem.</p><p>Psychologists sometimes address the problem of reverse causality by using early measures of traits determined well before the outcomes are measured to predict later outcomes. 90   This approach is problematic if the traits the analyst seeks to identify evolve over time and the contemporary values of traits drive behavior. This practice trades a reverse causality problem with a version of an errors in variables problem. Early measures of the traits may be poor proxies for the traits that drive measured current behavior. In our review of the literature in Section 7, we distinguish studies that attempt to control for reverse causality and those that do not. <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b532">Urzua [2008]</ref> demonstrate the importance of correcting for reverse causality arising from schooling affecting traits and traits affecting schooling in interpreting the effects of personality tests on a variety of socioeconomic outcomes.</p><p>Application of econometric techniques for determining the causal effects of factors on outcomes makes a distinctive contribution to psychology.</p><p>Many psychologists focus on prediction, not causality. 91 Establishing predictive validity will often be enough to achieve the goal of making personnel assignment and student placement decisions. 92 However, for policy analysis, including analyses of new programs designed to augment the skills of the disadvantaged, causal models are required in order to generate policy counterfactuals. 93   The papers of <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Cunha and Heckman [2008]</ref>, develop frameworks for circumventing the problems that arise in using predictive validity to 90 This approach is based on the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. 91 There is a long tradition in psychology of conducting predictive analysis based on factor analysis (see, for example, the essays in <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Cudeck and MacCullum [2007]</ref>), but there is no systematic treatment of the problem of reverse causality in that field. 92 See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">Hogan and Roberts [2001]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">Hogan and Hogan [2007]</ref>. 93 See <ref type="bibr">Heckman [2008a]</ref>.</p><p>define and measure personality constructs.

There are at least two types of false responses: those arising from impression management and those arising from selfdeception <ref type="bibr" target="#b409">(Paulhus [1984]</ref>). For example, individuals who know that their responses on a personality questionnaire will be used to make hiring decisions may deliberately exaggerate their strengths and downplay their weaknesses. 95 Subconscious motives to see themselves as virtuous may produce the same faking behavior, even when responses are anonymous.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.E. The Causal Status of Latent Variables</head><p>Some psychologists question the causal status of latent variables extracted from factor analyses of measurements across individuals. 99 Such factor analytic studies summarize interindividual variation but do not necessarily inform analysts about the effects of exogenously changing the factor in producing outcomes across individuals. In addition, variations of traits within persons may have very different effects than variations across persons. 96 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b514">Steele and Aronson [1998]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b469">Sackett, Hardison and Cullen [2004]</ref>. 97 Hough, Eaton, Dunnette et al.

So can hierarchical linear models. 101   These methods do not address the deeper problem that most of the estimates of "the effects" of psychological traits on outcomes (either from "within" or "across" studies) have no causal status. Structural equation methods have been used to estimate causal relationships using cross-person variation. They rely on the usual toolkit of simultaneous equations exclusion restrictions to secure identification. 102 Standard experimental and econometric techniques for inferring causality from within person changes have only recently been applied to generate causal effects of personality. 103 We review this literature in Section 8. 100 See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b394">Mundlak [1978]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">Hsiao [2003]</ref>. 101 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b427">Raudenbush and Bryk [2001]</ref>. 102 See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aigner, Hsiao, Kapteyn et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implementing the Measurement Systems</head><p>How do psychologists measure individual differences? In this section we analyze the major measurement systems for cognition and personality. We examine the relative performance of cognition and personality in predicting a variety of outcomes. For cognition, there is a fairly well-established set of terminologies and conventions. Aptitude tests are designed to measure differences in the rates at which individuals learn (i.e., fluid intelligence). Achievement tests are designed to measure acquired knowledge (i.e., crystallized intelligence). For personality, a variety of alternative measurement systems are proposed, and this is a source of confusion. We attempt to compare and equate these systems of measurement. We link them to measures of childhood temperament and psychopathology which are also used to describe individual differences. We note that the problems of operationalization and construct validity are present in analyzing any measures of traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.A. Cognition</head><p>Intelligence (also called cognitive ability and general mental ability) is defined by psychologists to include the "ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought" <ref type="bibr">(Neisser, Boodoo, Bouchard et al. [1996, p. 77]</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_25">104</ref> These are clearly distinct traits, and the literature distinguishes more finely among them. The term "IQ" is often used synonymously with intelligence but in fact refers specifically to scores on intelligence tests.</p><p>Notwithstanding a century of active study and general agreement about the sorts of tasks on which more intelligent individuals perform better, the construct of intelligence "resists a consensual definition." 105   Scores on different tests of cognitive ability tend to be highly correlated, with half or more of the variance of diverse tests accounted for by a single general factor labeled "g" and more specific mental abilities loading on other factors. 106 g is widely interpreted as general mental ability. 107 An extreme version of g-theory that is no longer widely accepted is that g accounts for all the correlation among different tests of cognition. 108   Psychometricians have expanded this notion to create a hierarchy of "orders." The order of a factor indicates its generality in explaining a variety of tests of cognitive ability deemed to satisfy construct validity. Tests have different emphases (for example, verbal ability, numeracy, coding speed, and other tasks). A first-order factor is predictive in all cognitive tasks, j=1,..., J in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_41">19</ref>). In modern parlance this general correlation is called " g ," but it is no longer viewed as the sole predictor of cognitive test scores. A lower-order factor is predictive of performance in only some tasks. Lower-order factors can be correlated with the higher-order factors and may be correlated with each other. They have independent predictive power from the higher-order factors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence</head><p>There is less agreement about the number and identity of lower-order factors. 110 Carroll [1993]   proposed a general intelligence factor g and several more specific second-order factors, including, but not limited to, what <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Cattell [1971;</ref><ref type="bibr">1987]</ref> dubbed crystallized and fluid intelligence. Crystallized intelligence, Cattell proposed, comprises acquired skills and knowledge and thus is partly dependent upon educational opportunity and motivation. Fluid intelligence, by contrast, is a general "relation-perceiving ability" (p. 138). Cattell's student <ref type="bibr" target="#b434">Rindermann [2007]</ref> elaborates:</p><p>"Fluid intelligence is the ability to perceive complex relations, educe complex correlates, form concepts, develop aids, reason, abstract, and maintain span of immediate apprehension in solving novel problems in which advanced elements of the collective intelligence of the culture were not required for solution" (p. 462).</p><p>In contrast, crystallized intelligence is the same class of skills, "but in materials in which past appropriation of the collective intelligence of the culture would give one a distinct advantage in solving the problems involved" (p. 462).</p><p>Carroll <ref type="bibr">[1993]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Horn and McArdle [2007]</ref> summarize the large body of evidence against the claim that a single factor g is sufficient to explain the correlation structure of achievement and intelligence tests. 111 Two pieces of evidence are worth highlighting. First, crystallized intelligence tends to increase monotonically for most of the life cycle, whereas fluid 110 Carroll [1993] analyzed 477 data sets and estimated a structure with g as the highest-order factor, eight secondorder ability clusters, and over 70 more narrowly defined third-order abilities on a variety of different tests.</p><p>Alternative hierarchical models, also with g as the highest-order factor, have been proposed (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">Lubinski [2004]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Horn [1970]</ref>). 111 Recent research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ardila, Pineda and Rosselli [2000]</ref> shows that more than one factor is required to summarize the predictive power of cognitive tests in economic data. This could be due to the existence of multiple intellective factors or because personality factors affect the measurement of cognitive factors as we discuss later on in this section.</p><p>intelligence tends to peak in very early adulthood then to decline. 112 Second, the well-known Flynn effect, which documents the population-wide increase in performance on intelligence tests over the past half-century, is particularly dramatic for measures of fluid intelligence but much smaller for measures of crystallized intelligence. 113 SAT scores have declined rather than increased over the same period, requiring a renorming in the 1990s.</p><p>The relative weighting of fluid versus crystallized intelligence varies among tests according to the degree to which prior experience is crucial to performance. These second order factors are correlated with the first-order factor g but also contribute additional explanatory 113 <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Dickens and Flynn [2001]</ref>. 114 Roberts, Goff, Anjoul et al.

The high correlation between intelligence and achievement tests is in part due to the fact that both require cognitive ability and knowledge, even if to different degrees, that common developmental factors may affect both of these traits, and that fluid intelligence promotes the acquisition of crystallized intelligence. 116 Cattell [1971; 1987]; <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">Gustafsson [1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b321">Kvist and Gustafsson [2008]</ref>.</p><p>117 <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">Gottfredson [1998]</ref>.</p><p>is that what is commonly meant by intelligence encompasses a number of distinct traits captured in the lower order factors of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.B. Personality Traits</head><p>We have noted in Sections 2 and 3 that sharp contrasts between cognition and personality are not easy to make. Consider, for example, the so-called "quasi-cognitive" traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b322">(Kyllonen, Walters and Kaufman [2005]</ref>). These include creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Csikszentmihalyi [1996]</ref>), emotional intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b352">(Mayer and Salovey [1997]</ref>), cognitive style <ref type="bibr" target="#b511">(Stanovich [1999]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b411">Perkins and Tishman [2001]</ref>), typical intellectual engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]</ref>), and practical intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b518">(Sternberg, Forsythe, Hedlund et al. [2000]</ref>). Furthermore, the Big Five factor of Openness to Experience has as facets curiosity ("ideas") and imagination ("fantasy") that are often associated with intellect and measured intelligence. 127 (See the entries under Openness in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">3</ref>.) We note in Section 5.C that personality can affect performance on tests of fluid intelligence.</p><p>Personality traits also affect acquired skills and knowledge (i.e., crystallized intelligence). 128 A general pattern is higher correlation of personality tests with tests of crystallized knowledge (e.g., achievement tests). 129 For many personality traits and for measures of cognition that are based on fluid intelligence, the correlations are close to zero, as we note below.</p><p>Finally, consider the construct of executive function. "Cognitive control" and "executive function" are terms used interchangeably, primarily in the neuroscience literature. Both have been defined as the voluntary, effortful blocking of a habitual behavior in order to execute a less familiar behavior. 130 Some authors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Gray [2004]</ref>) also use the terms "cognitive control" and "self-control" interchangeably, though self-control is traditionally considered a personality trait rather than an aspect of cognition.

The PFC achieves structural and functional maturity later than other (e.g., sensorimotor) brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Casey, Tottenham, Liston et al. [2005]</ref>).</p><p>Specific executive functions attributed to the PFC include abstract reasoning, planning, decision making, working memory (the ability to keep the facts of a problem at hand), attention, conflict monitoring, task switching, and inhibition of prepotent (i.e., dominant, habitual) impulses. While many functions have been attributed to the PFC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b374">Miller [2000]</ref> notes that "there is little agreement on the cardinal prefrontal functions" (p. 449). Nevertheless, there is some consensus that one can distinguish between working memory on the one hand, and response inhibition and task switching on the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">(Garon, Bryson and Smith [2008]</ref>, Miyake, Friedman, Emerson et al.</p><p>[ <ref type="bibr">2000]</ref>). This distinction is important because working memory is highly related to performance on measures of fluid intelligence. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_27">132</ref> Being able to access to all of the data about a problem is helpful in solving it. Thus, working memory is a common component of the constructs of both executive function and general intelligence. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_28">133</ref>While the construct of executive function demonstrates the inadequacy of terms such as "cognitive" and "non-cognitive", many personality traits nevertheless are conceptually and empirically easily distinguished from general cognitive ability. Most personality traits are in fact very weakly correlated with IQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b546">(Webb [1915]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b361">McCrae and Costa [1994]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b510">Stankov [2005]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]</ref>). Thus, regardless of the terms used to describe individual differences that determine life outcomes, one thing is clear: human ability entails more than intelligence. Personality traits, however defined, do matter, and they have independent predictive power from standard measures of intelligence.</p></div>

Source: Table adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">John and Srivastava [1999]</ref>.</p><p>Temperament is the term used by developmental psychologists to describe the behavioral tendencies of infants and children. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_29">140</ref> Because individual differences in temperament emerge so early in life, these traits have traditionally been assumed to be biological (as opposed to environmental) in origin. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_30">141</ref> However, findings in behavioral genetics suggest that, like adult personality, temperament is only partly heritable, and as discussed in Section 8, both adult and child measured traits are affected by the environment.</p><p>Temperament is studied primarily by child and developmental psychologists, while personality is studied by adult personality psychologists. The past decade has seen some convergence of these two research traditions, however, and there is evidence that temperamental differences observed during the preschool years anticipate adult personality and interpersonal functioning decades later (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Caspi [2000]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b398">Newman, Caspi, Moffitt et al. [1997]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b495">Shiner and Caspi [2003]</ref>). Column 5 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">3</ref> displays temperament traits that have been associated both theoretically and empirically with adult personality traits.</p><p>Historically, many temperament researchers examined specific lower-order traits rather than broader, higher-level factors that characterize studies of adult intelligence and personality. 142 Shiner [1998] suggests that "there is therefore a great need to bring order to this vast array of studies of single lower-level traits" (p. 320). Recently, taxonomies of temperament have been proposed that group lower-order traits into higher-order dimensions; several of these taxonomies resemble the Big Five (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">John, Caspi, Robins et al. [1994]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b425">Putnam, Ellis and Rothbart [2001]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b459">Rothbart, Ahadi and Evans [2000]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b495">Shiner and Caspi [2003]</ref>). However, compared to adults, there seem to be fewer ways that young children can differ from one another.</p><p>Child psychologists often refer to the "elaboration" or "differentiation" of childhood temperament into the full flower of complex, adult personality. The lack of direct correspondence between measures of temperament and measures of adult personality presents a challenge to researchers interested in documenting changes in personality over the full life cycle.</p><p>Developing the required measures is an active area of research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternatives to the Big Five</head><p>The Five-Factor model is not without its critics. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Eysenck [1991]</ref> offers a model with just three factors (i.e., Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Psychoticism). <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Cloninger [1987]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b526">Tellegen [1985]</ref> offer different three-factor models.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> shows the commonalities across some competing taxonomies and also areas of divergence. Solutions with more factors can increase the prediction of outcomes including job performance, income, and change in psychiatric status <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">(Mershon and Gorsuch [1988]</ref>). On the other hand, more parsimonious models in which the five factors are reduced to two "metatraits" have also been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Digman [1997]</ref>). In addition to these controversies, the facet-level organization of any given Big Five factor is subject to debate and controversy. Recent research suggests that the rush to accept the Big Five may be premature. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_32">143</ref> The first studies of the Big Five were based primarily on English speaking samples. And, although the Big Five structure appears to replicate across many cultures <ref type="bibr">(McCrae and Costa [1997b]</ref>), studies of more diverse cultures show that taxonomies known as the Big Six <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ashton, Lee, Perugini et al. [2004]</ref>) or the Multi-Language Seven (ML7; <ref type="bibr" target="#b475">Saucier [2003]</ref>), may better represent the personality domain. While they add one or two dimensions to the Big Five and shift the meaning of the Big Five slightly, they are, however, not very different from the Big Five. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_33">144</ref>One of the most stinging criticisms of the Five-Factor model is that it is atheoretical <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Block [1995]</ref>). It is derived from factor analysis of a variety of measures without any firm biological underpinnings. While research is under way on determining the neural substrates of the Big Five (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Canli [2006]</ref> and DeYoung, Hirsh, Shane et al. <ref type="bibr">[2010]</ref>), the finding that descriptions of behavior as measured by tests, self-reports, and reports of observers cluster reliably into five groups has not so far been satisfactorily explained by any scientifically grounded theory.</p><p>Some psychologists suggest that the categories are too crude to be useful. Estimates based on the Big Five factors obscure relationships between specific facets of the Big Five and outcomes. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_34">145</ref> Given that each Big Five factor is a composite of distinct facets, the predictive validities are diluted when analyses consider only factor-level aggregate scores. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b410">Paunonen and Ashton [2001]</ref> compared Big Five Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience with two related facets, need for achievement and need for understanding. In each comparison, the lower-level facet predicted course grades among undergraduates better than its higher-level factor measure.</p><p>The Five-Factor model is largely silent about motivation. In the notation of Section 3,  parameterizes preferences and goals. The omission of motivation (that is, what people value or desire) from measures of Big Five traits is not complete, however. The NEO-PI-R, for example, includes as a facet "achievement striving". Individual differences in motivation were more prominent in older (now rarely used) measures of personality. The starting point for Jackson's Personality Research Form (PRF; <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Jackson [1974]</ref>), for example, was <ref type="bibr" target="#b395">Murray's [1938]</ref> theory of basic human drives. Included in the PRF are scales for (need for) play, order, autonomy, achievement, affiliation, social recognition, and safety. The Schwartz Values Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b489">(Schwartz [1992]</ref>) is another self-report measure of motivation which yields scores on ten different motivations including power, achievement, benevolence, and conformity. Some motivation theorists believe that one's deepest desires are unconscious and, therefore, may dispute the practice of measuring motivation using self-report questionnaires (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">McClelland, Koestner and Weinberger [1989]</ref>). For a brief review of this debate and an overview of how motivation and personality trait measures differ, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b442">Roberts, Harms, Smith et al. [2006]</ref>.</p><p>A practical problem facing the analyst who wishes to measure personality is the multiplicity of personality questionnaires. The proliferation of personality measures reflects, in part, the more heterogeneous nature of personality in comparison to cognitive ability, although, as we have seen, various types of cognitive ability have been distinguished in the literature. 146   The panoply of measures and constructs also points to the relatively recent and incomplete convergence of personality psychologists on the Big Five model, as well as the lack of consensus 146 See, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Carroll [1993]</ref>.</p><p>among researchers about identifying and organizing lower-order facets of the Big Five factors (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">DeYoung, Quilty and Peterson [2007]</ref> and Hofstee, de Raad and <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">Goldberg [1992]</ref>). For example, some theorists argue that impulsivity is a facet of Neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Costa and McCrae [1992b]</ref>), others claim that it is a facet of Conscientiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b440">(Roberts, Chernyshenko, Stark et al. [2005]</ref>), and still others suggest that it is a blend of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and perhaps Neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b431">(Revelle [1997]</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> shows in italics facets of the Big Five whose classifications are under question. One reason for the proliferation of measures is the variety of alternative methodologies for verifying tests discussed in Section 4 which are not guaranteed to produce the same taxonomies.</p></div>

Self-Esteem and Locus of Control Are Related to Big Five Emotional Stability</head><p>The traits of self-esteem and locus of control deserve special attention since they are collected in large-sample longitudinal studies used by economists. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_35">147</ref> They are not part of the traditional Big Five typology.

Locus of control refers to one's belief about whether the determinants of one's life events are largely internal or external. Those with an internal (as opposed to external) locus of control believe that life events are typically caused by their own</p><p>actions. An example item from the widely-used Rotter Locus of Control Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">(Rotter [1966]</ref>) requires respondents to choose between "Many of the unhappy things in people's lives are partly due to bad luck" and "People's misfortunes result from the mistakes they make."</p><p>For the most part, researchers who study self-esteem and locus of control have carried out their work in isolation of each other and without reference to the Big Five taxonomy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.D.2. Relating the Big Five to Measures of Psychopathology</head><p>Extreme manifestations of personality traits may be a form of mental illness. Thus, a very conscientious person may be viewed as an obsessive compulsive person. It is of interest to consider how psychopathology may be characterized using the Big Five.</p><p>Psychopathology is defined by the APA dictionary as "patterns of behavior or thought processes that are abnormal or maladaptive." Used interchangeably with the terms mental illness and mental disorder, psychopathology is primarily studied by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. Historically, the study of psychopathology was carried out in near complete isolation from the study of "normal" variation in personality. Very recently, however, several attempts have been made to integrate taxonomies of psychopathology and normal personality Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 79 into a single framework. In particular, a compelling argument can be made for conceptualizing of and measuring mental disorders as extreme variants of personality traits (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b314">Krueger and Eaton [2010]</ref> and ensuing commentary). This approach is quite revolutionary in the study of psychopathology in at least two ways. First, it takes a dimensional as opposed to categorical characterization of mental disorders. By a dimensional approach, psychologists mean that traits lie on an underlying continuum and are not discrete valued. Second, the recent research relies upon structural validity (e.g., evidence of convergent and discriminant validity) rather than historical path dependency (e.g., diagnoses that persist because they are familiar to clinicians who learned about them during their training).</p><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association distinguishes between Axis I disorders, which are acute disorders requiring clinical attention (e.g., depression, schizophrenia) and Axis II disorders 148 , 10 personality disorders that are more chronic and, generally, less impairing of overall functioning. Research has documented that Big Five Neuroticism is a non-specific correlate of various Axis I disorders, and that various other reliable associations can be documented (e.g., the positive emotionality facet of Extraversion is associated with bipolar disorder); however, the direction of causality is difficult to ascertain in what have typically been cross-sectional studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bagby, Bindseil, Schuller et al. [1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Cloninger, Svrakic, Bayon et al. [1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b224">Gunderson, Triebwasser, Phillips et al. [1999]</ref>). Twin studies demonstrate that the shared variance in mental disorders and personality traits is predominantly genetic -that is, common genetic antecedents give rise to certain mental disorders and personality traits.</p><p>More research has examined relations between Axis II disorders and normal personality variation. Several authors have proposed a Big Four taxonomy (the Big Five minus Openness to Experience). <ref type="bibr" target="#b545">Watson, Clark and Chmielewski [2008]</ref> proposed that a fifth factor called Oddity is needed to model traits related to eccentricity. Others have argued that the Big Five structure itself, without modification, can account for Axis II personality disorders <ref type="bibr">(Widiger and Costa Jr. [2002]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b555">Widiger, Trull, Clarkin et al. [2002]</ref>). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b555">Widiger, Trull, Clarkin et al. [2002]</ref> suggest that all Axis II personality disorders can be "translated as maladaptively extreme variants of the 30 facets" of the NEO-PI-R, a widely used Big Five personality inventory. More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b473">Samuel and Widiger [2008]</ref> completed a meta-analytic review of the relationships between facets of the NEO-PI-R and Axis II personality disorders which we reproduce in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">4</ref>. Notably, personality disorders relate to multiple facets spanning more than one Big Five factor. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.E. IQ and Achievement Test Scores Reflect Incentives and Capture Both Cognitive and Personality Traits</head><p>We now elaborate on the discussion of Section 3 on the difficulty of isolating a pure measure of intelligence. Performance on intelligence and achievement tests depends in part on personality traits of the test taker, as well as their motivation to perform. 149 A smart child unable to sit still during an exam or uninterested in exerting much effort can produce spuriously low scores on an IQ test.</p><p>It is sometimes claimed that IQ tests measure maximal performance, i.e. that IQ scores reflect the application of the maximal capacity of the person to the test. 150 The analysis of Section 3 suggests that IQ scores should be standardized for effort. A series of studies conducted over the past 40 years support this concern.</p><p>These studies show that among individuals with low IQ scores, performance on IQ tests could be increased up to a full standard deviation by offering incentives such as money or candy, particularly on group-administered tests and particularly with individuals at the low-end of the IQ spectrum. 151 Engaging in complex thinking is effortful, not automatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b480">(Schmeichel, Vohs and Baumeister [2003]</ref>), and therefore motivation to exert effort affects performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b567">Zigler and Butterfield [1968]</ref> found that early intervention (nursery school, for example) for low-SES kids may have a beneficial effect on motivation, not on cognitive ability per se. In their study, the benefits of intervention (in comparison to a no-treatment control group) on IQ were not apparent under testing conditions where motivation to perform well was maximal. Raver and Zigler 149 It is likely that performance on personality tests can also depend on cognitive ability, but that is less well documented. For example, it is likely that more intelligent people can ascertain the rewards to performance on a personality inventory test. Motivation is sometimes, but not usually, counted as a personality trait. 150 A leading psychometrician, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Carroll [1993]</ref>, does not accept the notion that IQ captures maximal effort. 151 The incentives for invoking effort vary across studies.</p><p>[1997] present further evidence on this point.  Performance on the WASI as juniors was about 16 points higher than on the group-administered test as freshmen. Notably, on the WASI, this population looks almost "average" in IQ, whereas by Otis-Lennon standards they are low IQ. t(60) = 10.67, p &lt; 0.001</p><p>The increase in IQ scores could be attributed to any combination of the following 1) an increase in "g" due to schooling at an intensive charter school, 2) an increase in knowledge or crystallized intelligence, 3) an increase in motivation due to the change in IQ test format, and/or 4) an increase in motivation due to experience at high performing school <ref type="bibr" target="#b492">Segal [2008]</ref> shows that introducing performance-based cash incentives in a low-stakes administration of the coding speed test of the Armed Services Vocational Battery (ASVAB) increases performance substantially among roughly one-third of participants. Men with lower levels of Conscientiousness are particularly affected by incentives. Segal's work and a large body of related work emphasize heterogeneity in the motivations that affect human performance.</p><p>Almlund, <ref type="bibr" target="#b505">Duckworth, Heckman, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kautz 2/4/2011 87 Borghans, Meijers and</ref><ref type="bibr">ter Weel [2008]</ref> show that adults spend substantially more time answering IQ questions when rewards are higher, but subjects high in Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness are less affected by these incentives. They already operate at a high level even without these incentives. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b407">Pailing and Segalowitz [2004]</ref> find that an eventrelated potential (ERP) indexing the emotional response to making an error increases in amplitude when incentives are offered for superior test performance. 153 This effect is smaller for individuals high in Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability. Thus, IQ scores do not accurately reflect maximal intellectual performance for individuals who are low in Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability. Performance on IQ tests encodes, in part, how effective persons may be in application of their intelligence, that is, how people are likely to perform in a real-world setting.</p><p>However, it is far from obvious that motivation on an exam and motivation in a real-world situation are the same.</p><p>Like low motivation, test anxiety can significantly impair performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b260">(Hembree [1988]</ref>). That is, subjects do worse when they worry excessively about how they are performing and when their autonomic nervous system over-reacts by increasing perspiration, heart rate, and so on. Because individuals who are higher in Big Five Neuroticism are more likely to experience test anxiety, there is another reason, beyond incentives, why Emotional Stability can impact IQ scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b390">(Moutafi, Furnham and Tsaousis [2006]</ref>).</p><p>Many IQ tests require factual knowledge acquired through schooling and life experience, which are, in part, determined by the motivation, curiosity, and persistence of the test taker.</p><p>Thus, personality traits can also affect IQ scores indirectly through the knowledge acquired by individuals who are higher in Big Five Openness to Experience and Big Five Conscientiousness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Cunha and Heckman [2008]</ref> show a correlation between cognitive and personality factors of the order of 0.3 r </p><p>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004]</ref>, and Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua <ref type="bibr">[2006]</ref> show how schooling and other acquired traits substantially causally affect measured cognitive and personality test scores. We discuss this research in Section 8. Cattell's investment theory <ref type="bibr">[1971]</ref> anticipates recent findings that knowledge and specific complex skills depend not only on fluid intelligence but also on the cumulative investment of effort and exposure to learning opportunities.</p><p>How, then, should one interpret a low IQ score? Collectively, the evidence surveyed here suggests that IQ test performance reflects not only pure intelligence, but also personality traits To capture pure intelligence, it is necessary to adjust for incentives, motivations, and context in which the measurements are taken, using the framework discussed in Section 3.</p><p>Just as personality traits and incentives can affect IQ scores, they can also affect standardized achievement tests that are commonly used as proxies for pure intelligence. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6</ref>, below, show how scores on two achievement tests, the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) and the Differential Aptitudes Test (DAT), are decomposed into IQ and personality measures. 154 We adjust by Rotter and Rosenberg in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> and by the Big Five in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6</ref>. 155 154 AFQT and DAT scores are highly correlated ( 0.76 r </p><p>). See <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2010]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b302">Kilburn, Hanser and Klerman [1998]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b520">Sticht [1995]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b544">Wang [1993]</ref>. 155 The Big Five are not available in the NLSY79 data that have AFQT scores.</p><p>Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 89</p><p>A substantial portion of the variance in both the AFQT score and DAT scores is explained by personality factors. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_37">156</ref> The variance explained is less than the variance independently explained by IQ scores, but it is still substantial. Furthermore, the facets are incrementally valid in that they explain the variance above and beyond the variance that IQ explains when all three are included in a regression. These findings caution the interpretation that these commonly used tests proxy mental ability. They likely proxy aspects of personality as well. Ironically, the measure of intelligence used by Herrnstein and Murray in The Bell Curve to predict a variety of social and economic outcomes is substantially affected by personality measures. We discuss evidence about personality and standardized achievement tests further in Section 7.   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 92</p></div>

The Evidence on the Situational Specificity Hypothesis</head><p>Since the publication of <ref type="bibr" target="#b376">Mischel's [1968]</ref> book, psychologists have addressed the situational specificity hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis that situations help explain variations across people in actions, effort and behavior. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_38">157</ref> Boiled down to its essence, this hypothesis says little more than that situations affect actions and efforts in a nonlinear fashion, i.e., that in equations ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">15</ref>), situational variables enter in a nonlinear fashion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Personality and Preference Parameters</head><p>Measures of personality predict a wide range of life outcomes that economists study. However, with our current knowledge, it is difficult to relate them to economic preference parameters except, of course, when the traits are the parameters. Since personality psychologists define traits as "relatively" stable, person-specific determinants of behavior, preferences are the natural counterpart of these traits in economics. Preferences are unaffected by changes in constraints.</p><p>While personality might relate to preferences, the exact link is unclear. Do preferences generate measured personality? Does personality generate preferences? Or are both generated from other, deeper, parameters that are as yet unknown? The model in Section 3 links preferences to measured personality. This section reviews the empirical evidence linking preferences and personality and discusses the conceptual differences between the two.</p><p>Overall, the links between measures of personality and preferences are largely unexplored. However, some evidence suggests that social preferences can be linked to the Big Five. The link between traditional preferences, such as risk aversion and time discounting, and personality, remain largely unknown. Personality measures might allow economists to broaden the dimensions of preferences and could potentially resolve some apparent inconsistencies in observed choices that arise from commonly used preference specifications in economics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.A. Evidence on Preference Parameters and Corresponding Personality Measures</head><p>The features of preferences that receive the most attention in the economics literature-time discounting, risk aversion, leisure preference, and social preferences 159 -appear to have analogues in the literature in psychology. Delay Discounting: A participant is given a series of choices for whether he would prefer to receive smaller payments sooner versus a larger payments later. The amounts and times vary across choices. The choices can be over hypothetical payoffs or realstakes payoffs. (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011]</ref>) Marshmallow Task: A participant (usually a child) is given a marshmallow. The experimenter leaves the room and tells the participant that he will receive a second marshmallow if he resists consuming the marshmallow until the experimenter returns. The length of time that the participant waits is a measure of short-term discounting. Agreeableness, Inhibitive Side of Conscientiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Anderson, Burks, DeYoung et al. [2011]</ref>) Risk Aversion -Preference over different states of the world Lottery Choice Task: A participant is given a series of choices between a safe amount of money and a lottery. The lottery remains the same across choices, whereas the safe amount varies. The lowest safe amount for which the participant prefers the lottery is a measure of risk aversion. The choices can be over hypothetical payoffs or real-stakes payoffs. (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011]</ref>) Devil's Task (Slovic's Risk Task): A participant sequentially chooses between ten "switches" or urns associated with hidden payoffs. The participant is told that nine of the switches are associated with a reward and one of them results in a loss of all previous winnings. Once a participant chooses a switch, he cannot flip the same switch again. The participant can elect to stop picking switches at any time. The number of switches chosen is a measure of risk aversion. (see, e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b502">Slovic [1966]</ref>) Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART): The participant is given a computerized task in which he is presented with a series of "balloons" that can be inflated by "pumping" the balloon. The participant receives potential earnings each time he pumps a balloon. At any point, the participant can stop pumping, realize the potential earnings, and move to the next balloon.

[2010]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b501">Slovic [1962]</ref>. A recent example is the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) <ref type="bibr" target="#b328">(Lejuez, Read, Kahler et al. [2002]</ref>), a computer game in which participants make repeated choices between keeping a certain smaller monetary reward and taking a chance on an incrementally larger reward. In addition to the experimental measures, it is tempting to try to map preferences to more vaguely defined traits, but the precise mapping has not yet been made. Still, some speculation is useful. Time preference likely relates to Conscientiousness, Self-control, and Consideration of Future Consequences. Risk Aversion is likely related to Openness to Experience and impulsive sensation seeking, a trait proposed by <ref type="bibr">Zuckerman, Kolin, Price et al. [1964]</ref>, defined as "the tendency to seek novel, varied, complex, and intense sensations and experiences and the willingness to take risks for the sake of such experience." 161   Preferences for leisure may be related to several personality measures. The Big Five includes an Achievement Striving subscale of Conscientiousness, which describes ambition, the capacity for hard work, and an inclination toward purposeful behavior. <ref type="bibr">Jackson's Personality Research Form [1974]</ref> includes an achievement scale measuring the aspiration to accomplish difficult tasks and to put forth effort to attain excellence, as well as an endurance scale, measuring willingness to work long hours and perseverance in the face of difficulty, and a play scale, measuring the inclination to participate in games, sports, and social activities "just for fun." Industriousness has been proposed as one of six facets of Conscientiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b440">(Roberts, Chernyshenko, Stark et al. [2005]</ref>) and is plausibly related to the preference for leisure. 161 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b568">Zuckerman [1994]</ref>. Despite this intuitive mapping of preferences to traits, the empirical evidence supporting such mappings is weak. The few studies investigating empirical links typically report only simple regressions or correlations without discussing any underlying model. Some use survey and self-report measures similar to those used by psychologists rather than elicited preferences.</p><p>The last column of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">6</ref> gives an overview of papers investigating the links.</p><p>The evidence relating personality to time preferences is mixed. Using data from an experiment involving college students, <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Daly, Delaney and Harmon [2009]</ref> find that a factor that loads heavily on self-control, consideration of future consequences, elaboration of consequences, affective mindfulness, and Conscientiousness, is negatively associated with the discount rate.  When they separately regress delay acceptance on Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness , cognitive skill, race, marital status, age, and education, none of the personality traits are statistically significant at the 10% level. However, when they split Conscientiousness into an inhibitive side (moral scrupulousness and cautiousness) and a proactive side (the need for achievement), they find that the inhibitive side is positively associated with delay acceptance ( 0.13, 0.10) p  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>. This result highlights the importance of examining facets of the Big Five when considering the relationship between preferences and personality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al.

Further, Agreeableness is positively associated with risk aversion.

However, the empirical links between preference parameters and personality traits depend on the data used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.B. Mapping Preferences into Personality</head><p>Despite some plausible empirical and conceptual links between preferences and traits, a precise mapping between the measures is not yet available. In Section 3, we argued that measured personality is generated by underlying preference parameters and constraints. However, the preferences measured by economists are often chosen to ensure identification on particular types of data on choices and may be misspecified. Further, studies documenting relationships between preferences and traits typically only study correlations without being motivated by an underlying model. Hence causal claims are, at this stage, largely premature. There are two main reasons for the disconnection between measures of personality and measures of preferences.</p><p>First, economists typically study marginal rates of substitution, measured over relevant ranges via observed choices. Personality psychologists typically do not study these tradeoffs and often do not measure choices. Most approaches to measuring preferences in economics, whether observational or experimental, use some variation of revealed preference given observed choices.</p><p>In contrast, psychologists typically use surveys to elicit preferences, information, or "typical" actions. Some questions elicit how respondents would feel about a given outcome, without presenting an alternative outcome. While such questions may elicit some (unspecified) feature of preferences, it is not clear what is being measured. The difference in approach makes it intrinsically difficult to compare economic and psychological measures.</p><p>Second, traditional preference parameters may not span the entire space of human decisions measured by psychologists. Time, risk, social, and leisure preferences do not capture the only tradeoffs in life. While time preference, risk aversion, leisure preference, and social preference have analogues in psychology, many personality psychologists do not perceive selfcontrol and delay of gratification, risk-taking behavior and sensation-seeking, and motivation and ambition as the most important aspects of human decision making.</p><p>Economists typically make strong simplifying assumptions to make their models tractable and to secure identification. The estimated parameters are used to build models, evaluate policy, and create counterfactuals. The most widely used specifications of tradeoffs are through parameterizations assuming separability, and assume that marginal rates of substitution are summarized by one or two parameters. Personality psychologists do not have the same incentives as economists to describe behavior by simple specifications as they are often content to stop with rich descriptions and do not use their estimated relationships in subsequent policy analyses.</p><p>Thus, they allow for a more complex range of behaviors. The choice of measured traits is large and often defies a simple, tractable, explanation. As discussed in the previous sections, to economists these often appear to be arbitrary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.C. Do Measured Parameters Predict Real World Behavior?</head><p>One test of the stability of measured preferences is whether they predict behavior in other contexts. Several recent studies have investigated whether risk preference predict behavior. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011]</ref>, use an experimentally validated measure of risk preference in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and find that it predicts self-reported risky behaviors, such as holding stocks, being self-employed, participating in sports, and smoking, but it does not predict as well as a survey question about 'willingness to take risks in general.' However, the observed relationship might arise because both the self-reported behaviors and questions about willingness to take risk are noisy contemporaneous survey measures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al. [1997]</ref> measure risk tolerance, time preference, and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and find that risk tolerance predicts smoking and drinking, holding insurance and stock, and decisions to immigrate and be self-employed. However, measures of risk tolerance only explain a small fraction of the variation in risky behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Benz and Meier [2008]</ref> compare measures of social preferences with charitable giving in a field experiment and find that experimental measures do not predict real life behavior well.</p><p>the lab and the field and argue that this is not necessarily because people behave inconsistently, but because experimenters are not controlling for relevant aspects of the choice situation. This is just a rehash of the old person-situation debate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Falk and Heckman [2009]</ref> present a different interpretation of the value of experiments. We discuss the evidence below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.D. Integrating Traits into Economic Models</head><p>Behavioral economics has incorporated some aspects of personality psychology to investigate how standard models of preferences can be improved to better reflect reality. Behavioral economics has highlighted many so-called anomalies, ways in which standard preferences do not accurately describe human behavior. We can divide these attempts into two main approaches.</p><p>First, behavioral economists have tried to improve models of behavior by developing more flexible functional forms for preferences. Below we discuss some of the now standard examples, such as loss aversion, hyperbolic discounting, and reciprocity. These are not anomalies with respect to rationality, but are examples that challenge standard models of preferences. For example, the time inconsistent actions induced by hyperbolic discounting (defined below), are often described as "errors", but they are not. The agent is simply optimizing non-standard preferences.</p><p>Second, behavioral economists have introduced the concept of bounded rationality. These are behaviors for which there is no reasonable preference specification that can rationalize a behavior. They are called anomalies or biases relative to conventional economic choice frameworks. Examples include failure to predict the winner's curse, mental accounting, framing effects, failure to apply Bayesian updating, and default effects. We think of these as mental constraints, or traits, along the lines of the models discussed in Section 3. However, these examples are consistent with evidence reviewed below on the interaction between cognitive ability and preference parameters.</p><p>Note that while some of the nonstandard features of preferences may seem compelling, the higher level of generality tends to make it difficult to identify the parameters in the data commonly used by economists. See the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Hansen [2005]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.D.1. Traits as Constraints</head><p>Preference measurements that do not account for all of the constraints that agents face might be biased. In the model of personality in Section 3, we describe how agents act based on both preference parameters and productive traits that embody constraints. The marginal rate of substitution is typically identified through price variation. However, the true price ratio might also depend partly on the unobserved traits of the individual. Failure to account for the traits that reflect constraints could lead to bias.</p><p>The empirical literature has focused on the interaction between cognition and preference parameters. Virtually all methods of estimating time preference assume that respondents are equally numerate, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b413">Peters, Vastfjall, Slovic et al. [2006]</ref> show that this assumption is often untrue. Furthermore, more numerate individuals are less susceptible to framing effects and draw stronger and more precise affective meaning from numbers and comparisons using numbers. The confound with numeracy may explain why more intelligent (or educated) individuals often display lower discount rates when decisions require complex calculations to compare subtly different delays or reward amounts (for example, de Wit, Flory, Acheson et al. <ref type="bibr">[2007]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010]</ref>), but it does not shed light on why smarter individuals also have lower discount rates when choosing between relatively simple cash sums <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">(Funder and Block [1989]</ref>) and between non-cash rewards (such as smaller vs. larger candy bars in <ref type="bibr">Mischel and</ref><ref type="bibr">Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kautz 2/4/2011 109 Metzner [1962]</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_39">167</ref> A meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b494">Shamosh and Gray [2007]</ref> of 24 studies in which both IQ and discount rates were measured shows the two traits are inversely related ( 0.23) r   . The complexity entailed by comparing the present and future values of rewards suggests that the inverse relationship between discount rates and intelligence is not just an artifact of measurement. One explanation for this could be that cognitive ability is related to the ability to direct attention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Daly, Delaney and Harmon [2009]</ref> find that lower discount rates are associated with cognitive mindfulness, which includes the ability to control attention. Further, an individual with poor working memory and low intelligence may not be capable of accurately calculating or even perceiving the value of a deferred reward. At the least, making such calculations is more effortful (that is, costly) for individuals of low cognitive ability. If the cost of making calculations exceeds the expected benefit of such deliberation, the individual may choose by default the immediate, certain reward. However, it is important to be aware of reverse causality, since more patient individuals may also invest more in cognitive ability.</p><p>Measures of cognitive constraints also relate to measured risk preference. There is an inverse relationship between cognitive ability and risk aversion, where higher-IQ people have higher risk tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010]</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_40">168</ref> Reference dependence can lead subjects to be susceptible to framing, because they will perceive two identical lotteries differentially when one is framed as a loss and the other is framed as a gain. Some evidence suggests that individuals with higher cognitive ability and education are less risk averse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Burks, Carpenter, Goette et al. [2009]</ref> find that higher IQ individuals are more consistent in their choices between a lottery and fixed sums. They hypothesize that agents with higher cognitive ability can better translate their preferences into choices between lotteries.</p><p>Borghans, Golsteyn, <ref type="bibr">Heckman et al. [2010]</ref> find that while risk aversion is related to personality traits, ambiguity is not. In particular, IQ does not explain how subjects choose between a risky and an ambiguous urn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.D.2. Traits as Preferences</head><p>Some aspects of traits may be more naturally thought of as aspects of preferences than as constraints. For example, Openness to Experience might relate to a preference for learning, and Extraversion might reflect a preference for social interactions. The distinction between preferences and constraints often seems tautological. One way of incorporating personality into preferences is by modifying functional forms, which fall into two broad and sometimes overlapping categories. First, some of the domains which are traditionally treated as fundamentally different, such as risk and time preference, social and risk preference, and leisure and time preference, may be closely related and generated from a common set of psychological traits. Second, nonseparabilities could confound measures of tradeoffs. The literature on addiction presents an interesting class of nonseparable models. 169 So does the literature on exotic preferences in economics. 170</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multidimensionality</head><p>Marginal rates of substitution are often assumed to be generated by only one or two parameters, for example the discount factor and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

However, one or two parameters may not describe behaviour well. Conversely, some of the concepts analyzed separately in the literature may be governed by the same parameters.</p><p>In discussing the concept of time discounting, Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue <ref type="bibr">[2002]</ref> argue that time preference has three dimensions: impulsivity, the tendency to act spontaneously and without planning; compulsivity, the tendency to stick with plans; and inhibition, the ability to override automatic responses to urges or emotions. There may be multiple interpretations of this assertion.</p><p>First, the tradeoff between different time periods might be described by several parameters. Second, impulsivity, inhibition, and compulsivity might reflect constraints, i.e., something that affects shadow prices of consumption in different time periods. Third, the relevant tradeoff might not be between different time periods but, for example in the case of impulsivity, might be between various levels of sensation seeking, a behavior which is also related to risk seeking.</p><p>Like time preference, risk preference may depend on multiple parameters. As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b426">Rabin [2000]</ref>, the simple expected utility framework does not explain risk aversion over small stakes, since it would imply an implausibly high curvature of the utility function. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b513">Starmer [2000]</ref> for a review of the literature on departures from expected utility. When psychologists started measuring risk-taking behavior, they were puzzled by the large variance across domains (see the discussion of situational specificity in Section 2). More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b547">Weber [2001]</ref> shows that risk preference varies by domain, and a scale that assesses risk taking in five different domains shows low correlations across these domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b548">(Weber, Blais and Betz [2002]</ref>). One can Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 112 be quite risk-averse when it comes to financial decisions but risk-loving when it comes to health decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Hanoch, Johnson and Wilke [2006]</ref>). Weber's risk-return model of risk taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b550">(Weber and Milliman [1997]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b549">Weber and Hsee [1998]</ref>) finds that low correlations among risk-taking preference across domains can be explained by domain-specific perceptions of riskiness and return. <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011]</ref> find that a survey question on willingness to take risks within a domain predicts self-reported behaviors within each domain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Einav, Finkelstein, Pascu et al. [2010]</ref> also find that there are domain-specific components of risk-taking behavior.</p><p>Domain specificity might arise because sensation-seeking, enjoyment of risk per se, is an important aspect of risk preferences. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_41">171</ref>Ambiguity aversion, the disutility from model uncertainty, might help explain some apparent inconsistencies. Ambiguity aversion is measured as the tradeoff between lower expected return and higher model uncertainty. Ambiguity aversion explains Ellsberg's paradox: people tend to prefer an urn with a 0.5 probability of winning to an urn with an unknown probability where they are allowed to choose which side to bet on. One version of preferences over ambiguity is due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Gilboa and Schmeidler [1989]</ref>.

[2009]</ref> measure ambiguity aversion and risk aversion in a group of Dutch high school students and show that this aspect of choice is distinct from risk aversion.</p><p>There is no consensus on how social preferences govern choices. Social preferences refer to any explanation for non-selfish behavior, usually as measured in a dictator game where people have to divide a sum between themselves and another person. Typically, more than 60 percent of proposers give positive amounts, averaging 20 percent of the sum. A variation of this game is the classic ultimatum game in which a giver divides a sum between himself and another subject, the receiver, and the other subject can accept or decline the sum. If he declines, both will lose their money. Studies typically find that receivers decline if offered less than 20 percent. These results cannot be explained by pure selfishness. In the dictator game, the giver is willing to forgo his own consumption in order to increase another person's consumption, and in the ultimatum game, the receiver is willing to forgo his own consumption in order to decrease the giver's consumption if he pays him too little. Many studies seek to find deeper traits that govern these behaviors, such as preferences over the utility of oneself compared to others, efficiency, and fairness. The notion of fairness covers various concepts, including equality and rewards in proportion to talent, effort, kindness, or intentions. For reviews of this literature, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">List [2009]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Camerer and Fehr [2004]</ref>.</p><p>In the linear, separable model, where each good i X is the consumption of person i, we can think of the weights as caring or altruism, the fact that people often care about other people's utility or consumption. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b371">Meier [2007]</ref> for a review. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Fehr and Schmidt [1999]</ref> analyze inequality aversion in which people dislike inequality rather than valuing the consumption or utility of agents per se.</p><p>Caring and altruism have been shown to decrease with social distance. People typically care more about themselves than about others, and they are less altruistic the less well they know other people.</p><p>The social preference of reciprocity has been studied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Fehr and Gächter [2000]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">and Falk and Fischbacher [2006]</ref> present evidence on reciprocity and conditional cooperation, in which agents act in a pro-social or antisocial manner depending on the behavior of others with whom they interact. People exert positive reciprocity if they tend to reward others for kindness but negative reciprocity if they tend to punish others for unkindness. More precisely, they are willing to incur a cost in order to reward or punish others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Falk and Fischbacher [2006]</ref> develop a theory of reciprocity where utility depends on the kindness of others, which is a function not only of the outcome from the another person's action, but also of the perceived intentions. Reciprocity then reflects how much value a person puts on rewarding kindness. Economists could model these features by letting the person-specific weights on the subutilities depend on social distance and past actions of others. Reciprocity is often measured using a gift-giving game where the proposer offers a wage to a responder, who then subsequently chooses a level of effort. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">List [2009]</ref> argues that the importance of fairness preferences may have been overstated in the literature, that many of the observed results are due to concerns over either reputation or scrutiny by experimenters. Several studies have shown that observed reciprocity fades over a longer time frame than the short duration of lab experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Gneezy and List [2006]</ref>, Hennig-Schmidt, Rockenbach and Sadrieh [2010], <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">Kube, Maréchal and Puppe [2006]</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Andreoni's [1995]</ref> warm glow model of altruism suggests that people do not care about others, but value the act of giving.</p><p>Inequality aversion is distinct from caring in the sense that A's utility may be decreasing in B's consumption if it is higher than A's.

(See <ref type="bibr" target="#b525">Tausch, Potters and Riedl [2010]</ref> for a review.) This finding may be related to the notion of reciprocity. The distinction may be whether the preference is for people who have earned their reward for doing something "for me" or something admirable in general. Some aspects of preferences seem to be multidimensional. However, many preference parameters are correlated. For example, the social preference of "trust" relates to risk aversion and reciprocity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Altmann, Dohmen and Wibral [2008]</ref> measure trust as the willingness to give money to an investor in a trust game where he will only be repaid if the investor decides to return the favor. In this game, one can think of trust as the belief about how own actions affect those of others. They find that trust and positive reciprocity are positively related. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2008]</ref> find that most people exert positive reciprocity; positive reciprocity and negative reciprocity are only weakly correlated; and people who are negatively reciprocal are less willing to trust others. In situations involving trust, it seems natural that trust is closely related to risk and ambiguity aversion, that a person who is more prone to accept uncertainty is also more likely to trust others. <ref type="bibr">Altmann, Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kautz 2/4/2011 116 Dohmen and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Wibral [2008]</ref> also find that people who are less risk averse are also more willing to trust. However, they do not measure which beliefs the agents hold.</p><p>Care has to be taken in distinguishing trust from risk aversion. We demonstrate below how additively separable specifications of preferences impose observational equivalence between risk and social preferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak et al. [2005]</ref> find that people who receive oxytocin exhibit more trusting behavior in a real-stakes trust game. Oxytocin, however, does not make subjects more generous, suggesting that trust is not simply altruism. Additionally, oxytocin does not affect people's decision over risky outcomes when playing against a computer rather than a human. Combined, these findings suggest that there is a unique characteristic that affects willingness to trust, distinct from altruism and risk aversion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Fehr [2009]</ref> posits that this missing element might be "betrayal aversion." Using survey data from Germany, <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Fehr [2009]</ref> finds that risk preferences, betrayal aversion, and altruism (as expressed through volunteering) predict people's self-reported willingness to trust others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference Specifications and Their Consequences</head><p>The most restrictive version of the additively separable model suggests that the marginal rate of substitution between two goods does not depend on the consumption of other goods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Browning, Hansen and Heckman [1999]</ref> present ample evidence against this assumption. Apparent inconsistencies can arise if nonseparability is ignored. Further, estimates will suffer from omitted variable bias. 172   The additively separable intertemporal model imposes the requirement that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is the same as the relative risk aversion parameter.</p><p>However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al. [1997]</ref> find no evidence that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is correlated with risk tolerance. However, the sample on which they measure these parameters is small. <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Green and Myerson [2004]</ref> argue that risk and time belong to different underlying psychological processes. As evidence, they point out that the two constructs react differently to the same effect: for example, an increase in the size of reward generally decreases the discount on time but increases the discount rate when rewards are probabilistic. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_42">173</ref> This is evidence against the standard intertemporally separable model of risk aversion.</p><p>One type of nonseparability is between goods and the state or time period. The additively separable model allows for this type of dependence, represented by the subscript v on the utility function. While exponential discounting is still the most common representation of time preferences, experiments show that people tend to put higher weight on the present than on future periods than would be predicted by exponential discounting. This is the motive for hyperbolic discounting. The most often used specification is   ,   -preferences, where  is the usual discount factor while δ is an additional discounting of all future periods, is</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">        2 1 1 2 , ,... v v v v v v U X X u X u X u X         .</formula><p>The consequence of these preferences is that the tradeoff between period v and period 1 v  is not evaluated the same way from the perspective of period 1 v  and period v , leading to time inconsistency. 174 Other possibilities are that the discount rates change with age. Hyperbolic and age-dependent discounting makes use of the subscript v on the utility function. We may think of an agent in multiple periods as several agents who play a game with each other. The agent today might account for what future agents might do. Further, discount rates appear to vary inversely with the size of reward and vary with the type of reward offered. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_43">175</ref>As previously noted, the expected utility form for risk preferences does not explain risk preferences over small stakes, as argued by <ref type="bibr" target="#b426">Rabin [2000]</ref>. If subutility functions represent utility of lifetime wealth in different states, people should be approximately risk neutral for small stakes. However, people often avoid more than fair small bets. If this is explained by expected utility, then the curvature of the utility of wealth function would have to be implausibly high. <ref type="bibr" target="#b297">Kahneman and Tversky [1979]</ref> suggest that people are loss averse, i.e., that losses weigh higher than gains in the utility function. This would imply that people have state-dependent preferences, which can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">        1 2 1 1 2 2 , ,... ,... ...          n n K n n K K n U X X X X u X X u X X u X X</formula><p>where n is the current state, and where   u y  is higher for negative y than for positive y. Note that this specification is very similar to that of inequality aversion discussed above. Both models share the feature that people do not have stable preferences over levels, but over differences.</p><p>The concepts of loss aversion, reference point dependence, and endowment effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b529">(Thaler [1980]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b297">Kahneman and Tversky [1979]</ref>) are variations on this theme. If an agent has had an object in his possession for even a short amount of time, it affects how he trades it off against other goods. List <ref type="bibr">[2003]</ref> has shown that this effect disappears when agents have market experience. However, loss aversion will interact with many choices in life, for example, how agents evaluate lotteries.</p><p>Reference point dependence has also been demonstrated in dictator games. In the standard dictator game, the first player, the "dictator," is given a positive endowment and can choose to transfer some of it to a second player at which point the game ends. Numerous studies have shown that most dictators transfer a positive amount, even though they have no monetary incentive to do so. <ref type="bibr" target="#b335">List [2007]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Bardsley [2008]</ref> modified the standard dictator game by allowing dictators to take part of the second player's endowment. With this modification, most dictators did not transfer positive amounts to the second player.</p><p>Experimental measures of social preferences vary greatly across studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b329">Levitt and List [2007]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b336">List [2009]</ref> argue that the degree of scrutiny in the lab as opposed to in the real world may make subjects behave more pro-socially <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul [2005]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b334">List [2006]</ref>)</p><p>and argue against the "realism" of experimental data. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_44">176</ref> Further, several studies have found that people tend to be more selfish when the stakes of the game increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Carpenter, Verhoogen and Burks [2005]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b500">Slonim and Roth [1998]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b408">Parco, Rapoport and Stein [2002]</ref>).</p><p>There is evidence of substantial heterogeneity in preferences both between socioeconomic groups and within groups. Marginal rates of substitution depend on other factors such as education, age, cultural values, etc. 177 This evidence supports the claim that people are different at a basic level, since preferences govern the choices that shape life. However, preferences may be experience dependent. While most studies view life outcomes as the result of choices governed by exogenous preferences, and hence infer preferences from outcomes, initial conditions might determine both preferences and constraints on the available choices.</p><p>The motivation for preference specifications in economics is typically introspection, axioms about rationality, and convenience, rather than empirical evidence. When measuring preferences, functional forms are chosen in an attempt to minimize approximation error subject to identification. However, economists typically consider preferences over a limited range of fundamental attributes. Time, risk, and social preferences may not be the right dimensions of choice over which parameters are stable. Each of these domains seem to be guided by multiple parameters, and some of these parameters seem to matter for each of the domains. While the marginal rates of substitution economists measure are correct at observed prices, they may not be easily mapped into the conventional preference specifications. Personality psychology may help in guiding economists as where to look for more fundamental parameters. However, the potential is largely unexplained.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">The Predictive Power of Personality Traits</head><p>This section discusses the empirical evidence on the power of personality in predicting life outcomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that personality measures-especially those related to Conscientiousness, and, to a lesser extent, Neuroticism-predict a wide range of outcomes. The predictive power of any particular personality measure tends to be less than the predictive power of IQ but in some cases rivals it.</p><p>For three reasons, summarizing the large literature on the predictive power of personality on outcomes is a daunting task. First, the measures of personality and cognition differ among studies. As noted in Section 5, not all psychologists use the Big Five. We attempt to cast all measures into Big Five categories. When this is not possible, we discuss the measures used and how they relate to the Big Five measures.</p><p>Second, different studies use different measures of predictive power. Many studies report only simple correlations or simple standardized regression coefficients. 178 Such estimated relationships do not control for other factors that may influence outcomes. This is particularly problematic for estimated relationships between personality measures and other outcomes that do not control for cognition, situation, or the effect of other personality measures. Where possible, we report both simple and partial correlations.</p><p>We also consider a measure of predictive validity that extends traditional conceptions of variance explained. Recent work by economists relaxes the normality and linearity assumptions that underlie the use of simple partial correlations and standardized regression coefficients that are used in psychology. This method measures the predictive power of variables by the slopes of 178 Standardized regressions produce regression coefficients of outcomes divided by their standard deviations regressed on explanatory variables divided by their standard deviations. This produces correlation coefficients in bivariate regressions and partial correlation coefficients in multivariate regressions. See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Goldberger [1968]</ref>.</p><p>percentile changes on outcomes and not by variance explained. If outcomes are characterized by substantial measurement error, a low 2 R for a predictor may still be consistent with a substantial effect of the predictor on means and quantiles. 179   For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]</ref> report the effects of percentile changes in cognitive and personality measures on a variety of outcomes over the full range of estimated relationships, relaxing traditional normality or linearity assumptions and not relying directly on measures of variance explained. This approach to measuring predictive power is increasingly being applied by economists. 180   Third, many studies do not address the question of causality, i.e., does the measured trait cause (rather than just predict) the outcome? Empirical associations are not a reliable basis for policy analysis. Problems with reverse causality are rife in personality psychology.</p><p>Contemporaneous measures of personality and outcomes are especially problematic. For example, does greater Neuroticism lower earnings, is it the other way around, or do they mutually influence each other?</p><p>Few economists or psychologists working on the relationship between personality and outcomes address the issue of causality, and when they do so, it is usually by employing early measures of cognition and personality to predict later outcomes. As discussed in Section 4, using early measures of personality traits to predict later outcomes raises problems of its own.</p><p>We delineate how each study addresses causality. 179 The slope versus variance explained distinction is an old one. However, the use of slopes as measures of "importance" is problematic in general because of the arbitrariness in the scales of the dependent and independent variables. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Goldberger [1968]</ref>.) This arbitrariness is resolved in the new measure by mapping quantiles into quantiles. This literature is nonparametric. The measure is clear in its choice of units but the economic significance is still questionable. A better measure would relate costs of a change in the independent variable to the benefits. 180 See, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b416">Piatek and Pinger [2010]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Overview of the Main Findings</head><p>Before presenting a detailed survey of the effects of personality and cognition on a variety of outcomes, it is useful to have an overview of the main findings. One principle finding of our survey, consistent with the claims of the early psychologists cited in Section 2, is that Conscientiousness is the most predictive Big Five trait across many outcomes. However, other personality measures predict some outcomes.</p><p>Measures of personality predict a range of educational outcomes. Of the Big Five, Conscientiousness best predicts overall attainment and achievement. Other traits, such as Openness to Experience, predict finer measures of educational attainment, such as attendance and course difficulty. Traits related to Neuroticism also affect educational attainment, but the relationship is not always monotonic. Conscientiousness predicts college grades to the same degree that SAT scores do. Personality measures predict performance on achievement tests and, to a lesser degree, performance on intelligence tests.</p><p>Personality measures also predict a variety of labor market outcomes. Of the Big Five traits, Conscientiousness best predicts overall job performance but is less predictive than measures of intelligence. Conscientiousness, however, predicts performance and wages across a broad range of occupational categories, whereas the predictive power of measures of intelligence decreases with job complexity. Additionally, traits related to Neuroticism (e.g. locus of control and self-esteem) predict a variety of labor market outcomes, including job search effort. Many traits predict sorting into occupations, consistent with the economic models of comparative advantage discussed in Section 3. Personality traits are valued differentially across occupations.</p><p>All Big Five traits predict some health outcomes. Conscientiousness, however, is the most predictive and can better predict longevity than does intelligence or background.</p><p>Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 128</p><p>Personality measures predict health both through the channel of education and by improving health-related behavior, such as smoking.</p><p>The little evidence on the effect of personality measures on crime suggests that traits related to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are important predictors of criminality. These findings are consistent with the possibility that personality is related to social preferences, as discussed in Section 6.</p><p>Our survey, even though extensive, is not fully comprehensive. We place additional material in the Web Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.A. Educational Attainment and Achievement</head><p>We now turn to evidence for the predictive power of personality traits for educational outcomes, separately considering educational attainment, grades, and test scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Attainment</head><p>Despite recent increases in college attendance, American high school dropout rates remain high.</p><p>About one in four American students drops out of formal schooling before receiving a high school diploma, and in recent decades the dropout rate has increased slightly <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">(Heckman and LaFontaine [2010]</ref>). A growing body of research finds that personality is associated with educational attainment, suggesting that further study of personality and its determinants might shed light on the recent stagnation in educational attainment. We begin by reviewing evidence about the relationship of personality measures with years of schooling and then consider specific aspects of educational achievement.</p><p>Traits such as perseverance and preferences related to an interest in learning might lead people to attain more total years of schooling. Indeed some evidence suggests that this might be the case.  <ref type="bibr">[2004]</ref>).</p><p>The first two samples lack information on cognitive ability. Openness to Experience, however, is the only Big Five factor with moderate associations with general intelligence ( 0.33 r  in a meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]</ref>), and intelligence is associated with years of education ( 0.55 r  in Neisser, Boodoo, <ref type="bibr" target="#b397">Bouchard et al. [1996]</ref>). Thus Openness to Experience may proxy for intelligence. However, as Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> illustrates, controlling for rudimentary measures of crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence does not affect the coefficients on the Big Five within the third sample. 181 This sample differs from the others, because Openness to Experience is not strongly associated with years of education unconditional on intelligence, possibly because it is based on a smaller inventory of questions.</p><p>Conscientiousness, however, is associated with years of schooling to a similar degree as 181 Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_29">A7</ref> in Section A7 of the Web Appendix presents the full results from this regression. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_32">A8</ref> in Section A7 of the Web Appendix presents analogous results for high school graduation.</p><p>intelligence. In each study, schooling and personality are measured at the same point in time, so that for older individuals, personality is measured long after schooling has been completed. This complicates the interpretation of the estimated effects of schooling on personality in young samples.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">(Lounsbury, Steel, Loveland et al. [2004]</ref>). Still, interest in learning is not the whole story. Using prospective data, Lleras <ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref> finds that controlling for cognitive ability, three Conscientious behaviors (completing homework, working hard, arriving promptly to class) in tenth grade predicted educational attainment ten years later, whereas relating well to others, a behavior related to Extraversion and Agreeableness, did not.</p><p>Examining discrete educational decisions, rather than total years of education, gives a more nuanced picture. The decision to obtain a GED is a particularly telling example. Many view GED certification as equivalent to earning a high school diploma. Indeed GED recipients have the same distribution of measured achievement test scores as high school graduates who do not attend college. However, controlling for cognitive ability, GED recipients have lower hourly wages and annual earnings and attain fewer years of education, suggesting they may "lack the abilities to think ahead, to persist in tasks, or to adapt to their environments" <ref type="bibr">(Heckman and Rubinstein [2001, p. 146]</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">10</ref>, taken from Heckman, Humphries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Urzua et al. [2010]</ref>,</p><p>shows that GED recipients have cognitive skills similar to students who obtain high school diplomas but do not attend college. However, GED recipients have noncognitive skills (personality traits) similar to high school dropouts. 183 Supporting the evidence from the GED program that personality plays an important role in explaining educational attainment in adolescence, several prospective studies have shown that facets of Conscientiousness (e.g., self-control, distractibility) and facets of Neuroticism (e.g., internal locus of control) predict successful graduation from high school <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Bowman and Matthews [1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Gough [1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">Hathaway, Reynolds and Monachesi [1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b286">Janosz, LeBlanc, Boulerice et al. [1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b298">Kelly and Veldman [1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b553">Whisenton and Lorre [1970]</ref>). 184 Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_33">9</ref> presents findings from three more recent studies examining the relationship between locus of control, a trait related to Emotional Stability, and high school graduation. While the level of statistical significance varies across studies, the studies report remarkably similar estimates. When controlling for basic demographics, a one standard deviation increase in locus of control is associated with a 4.5-6.8 percentage point increase in graduating from high school. Two of the studies control for cognitive ability and find that the coefficient drops to between 1.4 and 1.5.</p><p>However, the measures of cognitive ability (course grades and AFQT score) are partly determined by locus of control, as discussed later in this section. *statistically significant at 10 percent level; ** statistically significant at 5 percent level; *** statistically significant at 1 percent level Several recent studies using methods that address measurement error and reverse causality corroborate the evidence that traits related to Neuroticism affect educational attainment.</p><p>For example, Heckman, Stixrud and <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Urzua [2006]</ref> account for the effect of family background on test scores. They correct for the influence of schooling on personality. They address measurement error in test scores. (Their estimates of the effect of schooling on these traits and on cognitive measures are discussed in Section 8.) Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">11</ref> shows that better adolescent personality traits -as measured by locus of control and self-esteem (traits related to Neuroticism)-increases the probability of graduating from high school (and stopping at high school) for males at the lowest quantiles of the personality distribution. However, at higher quantiles, the probability of stopping education at high school graduation is decreasing in measured personality, because those students continue on to college. As discussed in Section 3, the effects of traits on outcomes need not be monotonic. As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">12</ref> shows, both higher cognitive and personality traits have strong effects on graduating from a 4-year college at all deciles. Moving from the lowest decile to the highest decile in the measured personality distribution increases the probability of graduating from college more than a similar change in the cognitive trait distribution. These examples show why considering broad measures of education might obscure important relationships between skills and educational attainment and why assuming a linear-or even monotonic-relationship between skills and educational attainment might be incorrect. 185  Cunha, <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Heckman and Schennach [2010]</ref> use a dynamic factor model to investigate the development of both cognitive skills and personality traits during childhood, allowing for endogenous investment in skills and dynamic complementarities. They find that adolescent personality-as measured by a variety of behavior inventories-accounts for 12% of the variation in educational attainment, whereas adolescent cognitive ability accounts for 16% of the variation.</p><p>A separate, but related literature examines the importance of early attention (a trait related to Conscientiousness) and aggression (a trait related to low Agreeableness) in determining graduation from high school. Some studies find that aggression is particularly important compared to attention. <ref type="bibr">Duncan and Magnuson [2010a]</ref> find that when controlling for measures of intelligence and demographic variables, antisocial behavior, but not attention measured in childhood, predicts high school completion where antisocial behavior is negatively associated with completion. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Fergusson and Horwood [1998]</ref> find that teacher and parent ratings of conduct problems at age 8 are negatively related to predicted high school completion at age 18. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b543">Vitaro, Brendgen, Larose et al. [2005]</ref> examine individuals in a population-based sample of Quebec children and find that kindergarten teacher ratings of hyperactivity-inattention (inversely) predicted completion of high school better than did aggressiveness-opposition. Both attention and aggression likely play roles, but there is no consensus on their relative importance.</p><p>In sum, traits related to Big Five Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness are particularly important in determining how many total years of education individuals complete in their lifetimes. Two traits related to Neuroticism, locus of control and self-esteem, play a particularly important role for adolescent schooling decisions. Their effects differ across schooling attainment levels, suggesting that analysts should be wary of using years of schooling attained as the outcome variable compared to using the probability of attainment at different grades. Attention and early aggression, traits related to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, are also predictive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Course Grades</head><p>Conscientiousness is the most robust Big Five predictor of course grades, in terms of raw and partial correlations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b422">Poropat [2009]</ref> conducted a meta-analysis of Big Five personality traits and Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 143 course grades in primary, secondary, and post-secondary education, presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">13</ref>.</p><p>Associations between grades and Conscientiousness are almost as large as those between grades and cognitive ability.

Source: <ref type="bibr" target="#b422">Poropat [2009]</ref>.</p><p>A few prospective, longitudinal studies, have estimated the effect of Conscientiousness on course grades when controlling for baseline levels of grades. These studies help isolate the effects of personality on grades by reducing the potential for omitted variable bias and misleading halo effects -the propensity for teachers to favor students based on traits unrelated to academic achievement. In general, these studies support the conclusions of studies that do not account for halo effects. For instance, in a sample of American middle school students, selfcontrol predicts report card grades, controlling for both general intelligence and baseline grades  <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Duckworth and Seligman [2005]</ref>). Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Duckworth, Tsukayama and May [2010]</ref> use longitudinal hierarchical linear models to show that changes in self-control predict subsequent changes in report card grades.

Similarly, in a sample of kindergarteners, teacher and parent ratings of effortful control predicted performance on standardized achievement tests six months later when controlling for both verbal intelligence and family socioeconomic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b535">(Valiente, Lemery-Chalfant and Swanson [2010]</ref>).

For instance, the number of seconds a child waits for a more preferred treat in a preschool test of delay of gratification predicts the SAT college admission test more than a decade later, with raw correlations of 0.42 r  for the verbal section and 0.57 r  for the quantitative section <ref type="bibr" target="#b383">(Mischel, Shoda and Rodriguez [1989]</ref>). The Head-to-Toes and Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders tasks requires young children to inhibit automatic responses, pay attention, and keep instructions in working memory (e.g., to touch their heads when the experimenter says "touch your toes") <ref type="bibr" target="#b420">(Ponitz, McClelland, Jewkes et al.

In contrast, internalizing behavior (e.g. depression, anxiousness, withdrawal) and externalizing behaviors (e.g. aggression, hyperactivity, antisocial behavior) at school-entry do not reliably predict standardized achievement test scores. Attention skills are related to Conscientiousness; externalizing behavior is related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness; and internalizing behaviors are related to Neuroticism.</p><p>In sum, traits related to Conscientiousness play an important role in predicting achievement tests above and beyond cognitive ability. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 6, time discounting and risk aversion also relate to test score performance, suggesting that both personality-related traits and preferences are important determinants of outcomes, consistent with the economic model presented in Section 3. In contrast to educational attainment, traits related to Emotional Stability (the opposite of Neuroticism) are less important for test performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Where Course Grades and Standardized Achievement Test Scores Diverge</head><p>Course grades and standardized test scores are generally highly correlated. Each form of assessment provides reciprocal evidence on the validity of the other.  . 191 This strong association-and the objective of each form of assessment to gauge student learning-explains why standardized achievement tests and grades are widely assumed to be "mutual surrogates; that is, measuring much the same thing, even in the face of obvious differences." 192 What are these differences, and how might the contribution of personality to performance vary accordingly?</p><p>Standardized achievement tests are designed to enable apples-to-apples comparisons of students from diverse contexts. To this end, standardized achievement tests are uniform in subject matter, format, administration, and grading procedure across all test takers. A course grade, on the other hand might depend on a particular teacher's judgment.</p><p>The power of standardized achievement tests to predict later academic and occupational outcomes is well-established <ref type="bibr" target="#b319">(Kuncel and Hezlett [2007]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b468">Sackett, Borneman and Connelly [2008]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b557">Willingham [1985]</ref>).

However, they differ in important ways. The benefits of Conscientiousness, which inclines students to more productive work habits, seem greater for course grades than for test scores. This finding might explain why girls, who are higher than boys in Conscientiousness, reliably earn higher grades than boys in every subject from primary school through college -but do not reliably outperform boys on either standardized achievement or intelligence tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Duckworth and Seligman [2006]</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> Woody Allen</head><p>It is intuitive that personality traits affect labor market outcomes. Showing up is required for completing a task. Precisely quantifying the direct effects of personality, however, is more difficult. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_47">193</ref> Recently, social scientists have started to tackle the problem and, in general, find that of the Big Five, Conscientiousness and traits associated with Neuroticism (locus of control and self-esteem) play a particularly important role in determining job performance and wages.</p><p>The evidence suggests multiple channels of influence, including occupational matching, incentive scheme selection, absenteeism, turnover, and job search.</p><p>Aspects of job performance are related to academic performance. For example, both require completing work on a schedule and involve intelligence to varying degrees. It is therefore not surprising, that, as with academic performance, numerous studies and metaanalyses have found that Conscientiousness is associated with job performance and wages <ref type="bibr" target="#b400">(Nyhus and Pons [2005]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b472">Salgado [1997]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">Hogan and Holland [2003]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Barrick and Mount [1991]</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">16</ref> presents correlations of the Big Five and IQ with job performance. Of the Big Five, Conscientiousness is the most associated with job performance but is about half as predictive as IQ. Conscientiousness, however, may play a more pervasive role than IQ. The importance of IQ increases with job complexity, defined as the information processing requirements of the job: cognitive skills are more important for professors, scientists, and senior managers than for semi-skilled or unskilled laborers <ref type="bibr" target="#b481">(Schmidt and Hunter [2004]</ref>). In contrast, the importance of Conscientiousness does not vary much with job complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Barrick and Mount [1991]</ref>), suggesting that it pertains to a wider spectrum of jobs. Causality remains an open question, as it does in most of the literature in psychology. The raw correlations presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">16</ref> do not account for reverse causality, and the authors do not clearly delineate when the measures of personality were taken.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation</head><p>Facets related to Emotional Stability (the opposite of Neuroticism) are also important for labor market success. Accounting for reverse causality, however, is particularly important, because strong evidence suggests labor market participation can affect traits related to Neuroticism (See the discussion of the research of <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Gottschalk [2005]</ref> in Section 8). Several studies have addressed this problem by using measures of personality measured well before individuals enter the labor market and find that locus of control and self-esteem, two facets of Emotional Stability, predict wages <ref type="bibr" target="#b296">(Judge and Hurst [2007]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Drago [2008]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Duncan and Dunifon [1998]</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_40">11</ref> presents results from the structural model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]</ref> suggesting that standardized adolescent measures of locus of control and self-esteem predict adult earnings to a similar degree as cognitive ability. However, the effects vary across educational levels. In general, noncognitive ability (personality) affects wages to a similar degree across all education levels, whereas cognitive ability tends to have little effect for GED recipients, high school dropouts, and college dropouts. More recent evidence, however, suggests that personality affects wages mostly through the channel of educational attainment. In Section 7.A, we presented evidence that personality measures (along with measurements of cognition) are strong predictors of educational attainment. Heckman, Humphries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Urzua et al. [2010]</ref> estimate a model of sequential educational choice and find that personality, as measured by participation in adolescent risky behaviors, primarily affects age 30 earnings through its effects on education. They find that given educational attainment, the effects of personality variables on outcomes are weak. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_48">194</ref>Further highlighting the possible role of educational decisions, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">17</ref> shows that GED recipients -who have lower levels of non-cognitive skills but comparable levels of cognitive skills (see the previous section) -have lower wages, lower total wage income, and work fewer hours relative to high school graduates, when controlling for ability. Other studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Cattan [2010]</ref>, using other measures of personality traits, find that the traits affect earnings above and beyond their effects on education and the effects of education on earnings. Resolving these disparate findings is an important topic for future research.  Personality plays a role outside of formal employer-employee relationships. Selfemployed workers, with either very low or high levels of risk-aversion, a trait related to dimensions of personality as discussed in Section 6, tend to remain self-employed for a shorter time, suggesting that they are less suited to self employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Caliendo, Fossen and Kritikos [2008]</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_50">196</ref>Personality could directly affect the duration of unemployment spells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">Gallo, Endrass, Bradley et al. [2003]</ref> finds that an internal locus of control is associated with a higher probability of reemployment. A couple of studies have explicitly incorporated locus of control into standard job search models. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Caliendo, Cobb-Clark and Uhlendorff [2010]</ref> examine whether a higher locus of control increases the perceived marginal benefit of exerting search effort, so that people with a more internal locus of control will search more intensely and will have a higher reservation wage. Supporting their theory, a one standard deviation increase in internal locus of control was associated with a 1.9% increase in the reservation wage ( 0.01) p  and a 5.3% increase in the number of job applications submitted ( 0.01) p  , controlling for demographic characteristics and past employment history. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_51">197</ref> While the measures were contemporaneous, the respondents became unemployed near the time that the locus of control was measured, potentially limiting the role of reverse causality. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">McGee [2010]</ref> proposes a model in which people with a higher locus of control believe that search effort has a higher return. The theoretical model predicts that those with an internal locus of control search more intensely but have higher reservation wages, so that the effect on the hazard rate of leaving unemployment is ambiguous. In line with his predictions, he finds that a one standard deviation increase in pre-labor market locus of control is associated with a 1.3% increase in the reservation wage ( 0.01) p  and a 20% increase in the time spent searching for a job per week ( 0.14) p </p><p>. 198   Those with moderate levels of locus of control have the highest hazard rates for leaving unemployment. Consistent with the interpretation that locus of control affects beliefs (not productivity), locus of control has no effect on reemployment wages when controlling for reservation wages.</p><p>Personality traits also affect occupational choice. From an economic perspective, some personality traits that reflect ability might be valued more highly in some occupations, and, on the supply side, people with certain personality traits that relate to preferences might value the non-pecuniary benefits associated with particular occupations. Supporting this notion, Conscientiousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Barrick and Mount [1991]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">Ham, Junankar and Wells [2009]</ref>), locus of control and self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">(Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]</ref>) predict sorting into occupations.</p><p>However, these studies use relatively broad occupational categories that might obfuscate more nuanced influences of personality. Analyzing eighteen occupational categories, Cobb-Clark and Tan <ref type="bibr">[2009]</ref> find that for men, a one standard deviation increase in Agreeableness is associated with a 2.8% decrease in the probability of being a manager ( 0.01) p  and a 2.9% decrease in being a business professional ( 0.01) p </p><p>. A standard deviation increase in internal locus of control is associated with 2.8% decrease in the probability of being a manager ( 0.01) p </p><p>. In contrast, for women, a one standard deviation increase in Openness to Experience is associated with a 2.5% increase in being a manager ( 0.01) p </p><p>. 199,200   Furthermore, the value of cognitive ability and personality differs based on occupation just as they do by education. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Cattan [2010]</ref> estimates a structural model of comparative advantage along the lines discussed in Section 3 and finds different skills are valued differently, depending on the occupation. Accounting for selection, a standard deviation increase in adolescent sociability (related to Extraversion) leads to a 6% increase in the wages of managers ( 0.01) p </p><p>, a 4% increase in the wages of sales workers ( 0.10) p </p><p>, a 2% increase in the wages of clerical workers ( 0.05) p </p><p>, but leads to a 2% decrease in wages of professionals ( 0.10) p  and has no significant impact on the wages of blue-collar workers. Self-esteem and locus of control are positively valued in all occupations, but the magnitudes also depend on the occupation. The effects of traits need not be uniform on wages across occupations.</p><p>Personality might affect not only the occupational selection, but also the type of compensation scheme selected within occupation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">Dur, Non and Roelfsema [2010]</ref> extend the standard principal-agent model by allowing for workers to reciprocate positive attention from managers by working harder. Their theoretical model implies that promotions, rather than monetary incentives, should be more effective for eliciting effort from reciprocal workers.</p><p>Workers self-select into different compensation schemes. Supporting their model, they find that a one point increase on a seven point reciprocity scale for workers is associated with a 5 percentage point increase of having a job with promotion incentives ( 0.01) p </p><p>. They use contemporaneous measures of reciprocity and job attributes, which could be problematic if payfor-performance schemes affect reciprocity. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2009]</ref> find that in a German sample self-reported positive reciprocity is associated with income, and employment, and working over time. Negative reciprocity tends to work in the opposite direction. As discussed in Section 6, these measures of social preference relate to personality. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_54">201</ref>In sum, there are good theoretical reasons as well as some empirical evidence that personality affects labor market outcomes through channels other than education.</p><p>Conscientiousness and Neuroticism are associated with job performance and wages to a similar but lesser degree than cognitive ability. The personality traits are more important for people with lower levels of job complexity or education level, whereas cognitive ability is more important at higher levels of job complexity. Nevertheless, some research suggests that facets related to Neuroticism might affect labor outcomes primarily through the channel of educational attainment. Other traits, such as Openness to Experience and Agreeableness affect more specific outcomes, such as selection into particular careers or type of compensation.

Hippocrates argued that an imbalance of the four temperaments would affect both personality and physical health. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_56">203</ref> Consistent with Hippocrates' ideas, recent evidence suggests that personality predicts health. The mechanisms are relatively unexplored but some empirical evidence suggests that personality affects health-related behavior, psychological responses, and social relationships <ref type="bibr">(Kern and Friedman [2010a]</ref>).</p><p>A growing body of work shows that personality measures predict longevity. Roberts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b445">Kuncel, Shiner et al. [2007]</ref> review evidence from 34 different studies on the predictive validity of Big Five personality traits, relative to that of cognitive ability and socioeconomic status, for longevity. Most studies in their meta-analysis control for relevant background factors, including gender and severity of disease. Roberts and colleagues convert the results of each study into correlation coefficients that can be compared across studies. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">18</ref>, Conscientiousness was a stronger predictor of longevity than any other Big Five trait and a stronger predictor than either IQ or socioeconomic status. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_57">204</ref> In general, traits related to Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Agreeableness are associated with longer lives, whereas those related to Neuroticism are associated with shorter life spans. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_58">205</ref> The magnitudes of the relationships, however, vary across studies and not all results are replicable. While the specific channels through which personality affects longevity and health are largely unknown, several studies provide some clues. Personality may affect health-related behavior, such as smoking, diet, and exercise. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Hampson, Goldberg, Vogt et al. [2007]</ref> find that high scores of teacher-assessments of Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness during elementary school predict overall health status during midlife (less smoking, more exercise, better self-rated health) and indirectly affect health through educational attainment. The correlations that were statistically significant at the 5% level or less ranged from 0.06 for the effect of Extraversion on physical activity to 0.12 for the effect of Conscientiousness on self-reported health status. Both the initial level and the growth in hostility (a facet of Neuroticism) throughout elementary school predict cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use in high school, and sociability (a trait related to Extraversion) predicts drinking but not smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Hampson, Tildesley, Andrews et al. [2010]</ref>). As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">19</ref>   Although many studies control for socioeconomic and health factors associated with mortality, most do not explore how personality affects health throughout the life-cycle <ref type="bibr">(Kern and Friedman [2010b]</ref>). The relationship between health and personality is complicated because Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 165 health can affect personality. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_59">206</ref> Some studies investigate the mechanisms by which personality affects health by considering how initial endowment of traits and health affect mid-life outcomes, such as healthy behavior and education, which in turn can influence health and longevity. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Gale, Batty and Deary [2008]</ref> find that a one standard deviation increase in age-10 locus of control decreases the risk of adult obesity by 8% ( 0.05 p </p><p>).</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Friedman, Kern and Reynolds [2010]</ref> find that in a cohort of gifted children, Conscientiousness better predicted longevity and social interactions at age 70. They find that</p><p>Neuroticism is associated with worse health for women but better health for men. These studies do not account for the possibility that health and personality exhibit dynamic complementarities over the life cycle.</p><p>Several studies have controlled for reverse-causality by using structural models to estimate the life-cycle evolution of health. Using a structural model of skill expression, <ref type="bibr">Conti and Heckman [2010]</ref> estimate the causal relationship between personality traits, initial health endowments and endogenous choices about schooling and post-schooling outcomes. They find that women sort into higher education based on cognitive ability, personality traits and initial health endowment. Furthermore, personality and health status measured during youth explain more than half of the difference in poor health, depression and obesity at age 30. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">20</ref> shows that for males, personality and health endowments are more predictive than the cognitive ones, whereas for females all three are similarly predictive. Using similar methods, Savelyev</p><p>[2010] finds that both child Conscientiousness and higher education increase survival through age 80, but these traits serve as substitutes for each other so that effects of education are only strong at low levels of Conscientiousness. In sum, Conscientiousness seems to be the most important Big Five trait in predicting health outcomes. Personality likely affects health through behaviors such as smoking, eating, and exercising. Studies that model the dynamic evolution of health over the life cycle find that personality affects health outcomes as much as cognitive measures or even more so in some cases.</p><p>Almlund  <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">(John, Caspi, Robins et al.

First, we discuss the contribution of ontogeny (programmed developmental processes common to all persons) as well as sociogeny (shared socialization processes) and show how aspects of personality, such as sensation-seeking, evolve as the brain develops. Second, we show how personality changes through external forces that operate through alterations in normal biology, such as brain lesions and chemical interventions.

Broad Evidence on Changes in Traits over the Life Cycle</head><p>The malleability of personality can be defined and measured in several ways: Mean-level change refers to change over time in absolute levels of a trait and is measured by changes in measures of a trait over time. Rank-order change, in contrast, refers to changes in the ordinal ranking of a trait in a population and is measured by rank correlations among longitudinal measures. One commonly held view is that rank-order or mean-level change in personality is nearly impossible after early adulthood. The speculation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">James [1890]</ref> that "in most of us, by the age of thirty, the character has set like plaster, and will never soften again" (pp. 125-126) is widely touted (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Costa and McCrae [1994]</ref>, McCrae and <ref type="bibr" target="#b360">Costa [1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b568">1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">2003]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Costa, McCrae and Siegler [1999]</ref>). However, mounting evidence suggests that the personality-as-plaster view is not correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b447">(Roberts, Walton and Viechtbauer [2006]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b446">Roberts and Mroczek [2008]</ref>).</p><p>During the early years of life, mean-level changes in measured traits are obvious and dramatic. For example, children become much more capable of self-control as they move from infancy into toddler and preschool years <ref type="bibr" target="#b356">(McCabe, Cunnington and Brooks-Gunn [2004]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b380">Mischel and Metzner [1962]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b423">Posner and Rothbart [2000]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b540">Vaughn, Kopp and Krakow [1984]</ref>).</p><p>But mean-level changes in measured personality are also apparent, albeit less extreme, later in life. In a 2006 meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b447">Roberts, Walton and Viechtbauer [2006]</ref> examine cumulative lifetime change in Big Five Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness. They disaggregate Big Five "Extraversion" into social dominance (assertiveness, dominance) and social vitality (talkativeness, gregariousness, and sociability). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">22</ref> shows that people typically become more socially dominant, conscientious, and emotionally stable (non-neurotic) across the life cycle, whereas social vitality and Openness to Experience rise early in life and then fall in old age.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_64">foot_64</ref> Surprisingly, after childhood, the greatest mean-level change in most measured personality traits takes place not during adolescence, but rather in young adulthood. In contrast, a longitudinal study of adult intellectual development shows mean-level declines in cognitive skills, particularly cognitive processing speed, after age 55 or so <ref type="bibr" target="#b479">(Schaie [1994]</ref>). The top panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">23</ref> shows mean-level changes in cognitive skills using a longitudinal analysis, and the bottom panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">23</ref> shows mean-level changes using a cross-sectional analysis. 212 As schematically illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_28">24</ref>, fluid intelligence decreases and crystallized intelligence rises over the life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">(Horn [1970]</ref>). Accumulated skills and knowledge are important: most of us would rather use an experienced cardiac surgeon who has seen hundreds of cases just like ours to perform our surgery, rather than an exceptionally bright young surgeon with minimal experience. 212 Cross-sectional estimates of mean-level change are biased by cohort effects (for example, the Flynn effect) whereas longitudinal estimates are biased by test-retest learning (when the same IQ tests are administered repeatedly to the same subjects) and by selective attrition. Thus, both estimates must be considered in conjunction as evidence for mean-level change. Rank-order stability in measured personality increases steadily over the lifespan. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">25</ref> shows that seven-year test-retest stability estimates for personality plateau far from unity, at 0.74 r </p><p>, about the same level as terminal stability estimates for IQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b441">(Roberts and DelVecchio [2000]</ref>). However, measured personality does not reach this plateau until at least age 50; whereas IQ reaches this plateau by age six or eight <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">(Hopkins and Bracht [1975]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b486">Schuerger and Witt [1989]</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">26</ref> shows rank order stability of IQ over broad age ranges. 0.9 0-2.9 3-5.9 6-11.9 12-17.9 18-21.9 adulthood whereas environmental factors are mostly responsible for change <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Blonigen, Hicks, Krueger et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>214,215</head><p>In a longitudinal study of twins surveyed at age 20 and then again at age 30, about 80 percent of the variance of the stable component of personality was attributed to genetic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b368">(McGue, Bacon and Lykken [1993]</ref>). In the same study, change in measured personality was mostly attributed to environmental factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">Helson, Kwan, John et al. [2002]</ref>, for example, document the substantial influence that social roles and cultural milieu can have on personality development. Their analysis is consistent with an economic model of investment and the response of measured traits to incentives. However, recent evidence suggests that environmental factors, and in particular stable social roles, also contribute to stability in personality and that genetic factors can contribute to change (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b448">Roberts, Wood and Caspi [2008]</ref> for a review).</p><p>Research on IQ also points to the enduring effects of genes, in contrast to more transient effects of environmental influences, which depend on a multitude of unstable variables, including social roles, levels of physical maturity and decline, and historical and cultural milieu. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_67">216</ref> Increases in the heritability of IQ from childhood (about 40 percent) to adulthood (estimates range from 60 percent to 80 percent) are well-documented in studies of behavioral genetics and possibly reflect increasing control of the individual (vs. parents) over environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Bergen, Gardner and Kendler [2007]</ref>; McGue, <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">Bouchard, Iacono et al. [1993]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b418">Plomin, DeFries, Craig et al.

[2003]</ref> find estimates from such studies to be biased downward by the over-representation of middle-and upper-class families.</p><p>Among poor families, Turkheimer et al. find that 60 percent of the variance in IQ is accounted for by shared environment and heritability estimates are much smaller than they are for affluent families, whereas among affluent families, the contribution of heritability is much larger.</p><p>Krueger and colleagues have recently demonstrated that other moderators also influence the heritability of traits (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">Krueger, South, Johnson et al. [2008]</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_68">219</ref>Genes exert their influence in part through the selection and evocation of environments that are compatible with one's genotype-a phenomenon sometimes referred to as "geneenvironment correlation" or "nature via nurture" (see <ref type="bibr">Rutter [2006a]</ref>). As individuals move from childhood to adulthood, they have more control over their environments, and thus geneenvironment correlation becomes more important because shared environments become less common. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_69">220</ref>Substantial but temporary influence of environment is a basic assumption of the Dickens-Flynn model reconciling the high heritability of IQ and massive gains of IQ between generations 217 Devlin, Daniels and Roeder [1997] suggest that traditional estimates of the heritability of IQ may be inflated because they fail to take into account the effect of the environment of the maternal womb. See also <ref type="bibr">Rutter [2006b]</ref> and an emerging literature on epigenetics. 218 Lykken [2007] suggests that heritability estimates for personality are substantially higher when situational influence and measurement error are minimized by taking multiple measures at least a few months apart. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Dickens and Flynn [2001]</ref>). 221 The relatively short half-life of common environmental influences may also explain why adopted children resemble their biological parents more and more and their adopted parents less and less as they grow older <ref type="bibr" target="#b478">(Scarr, Weinberg and Waldman [1993]</ref>). 222   It is important to note that the family studies of genetic influence measure only the effects of shared environments, which become less similar as children age. Thus even identical twins may be motivated to seek out different environments over time <ref type="bibr">(Rutter [2006a]</ref>). Recent evidence that first born children grow up, on average, to have three points higher IQ than their younger siblings reinforces the point that parents do not necessarily provide identical environments in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">(Kristensen and Bjerkedal [2007]</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Conti, Heckman, Yi et al. [2010]</ref> demonstrate how parents differentially respond to health shocks of identical twins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">Lizzeri and Siniscalchi [2008]</ref> develop an economic model of differential parenting of siblings.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, genes could affect not only the base level of personality but also how personality changes over the life cycle. Just as people grow taller throughout childhood, people's personalities might naturally develop, even without investment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b515">Steinberg [2008]</ref> speculates that typical biological (ontogenic) development explains the surge of risk-taking in adolescence followed by the decline in adulthood. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">27</ref> illustrates his conjecture about how basic intellectual ability and psychosocial maturity (related, e.g., to impulsivity, risk perception, 221 A second crucial assumption is that environmental influence can be amplified by a "social multiplier" effect: smarter individuals create for one another an enriched environment, which in turn increases intelligence, and so on. Some caution must be taken in relying on the claims in this literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Blair, Gamson, Thorne et al. [2005]</ref> attribute the Flynn effect to increasing access to formal schooling early in the twentieth century and, from the mid-century onward, to increasing fluid cognitive demand of mathematics curricula. <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Flynn [2007]</ref> concurs about the former but believes that the latter had negligible impact. 222 The literature establishes that shared environments become less important as children age. This literature does not say that environments do not matter. This effect can arise because genetically similar children (or their parents) choose different environments to distinguish themselves or because of parental investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b337">(Lizzeri and Siniscalchi [2008]</ref>).</p><p>sensation-seeking, future orientation) evolve over the life cycle. 223 He argues that intellectual ability peaks around age 16, whereas psychosocial maturity develops during late adulthood. In his model, the increase in adolescent risk taking is due to a restructuring of the brain's dopaminergic system (responsible for the brain's reward processing) in such a way that immediate or novel experiences yield higher rewards, especially in the presence of peers. He attributes declines in risk-taking due to development of the brain's cognitive control system, specifically improvements in the prefrontal cortex which promote aspects of executive function such as response inhibition, planning ahead, weighing risks and rewards, and the simultaneous consideration of multiple information sources. Interestingly, even in his model, sensationseeking partly depends on the presence of peers, which corresponds to aspects of the situation ( ) h in the framework of Section 3. This example highlights the difficulty in disentangling situational and biological changes in personality. What factors other than preprogrammed genetic influences might account for mean-level changes in personality? Personality change in adulthood may be precipitated by major shifts in social roles (for example, getting a job for the first time or becoming a parent). If social role changes are experienced by most people in a population at the same time, we will observe the effects as mean-level changes in measured personality. If, on the other hand, these social roles are not assumed synchronously, we will observe rank-order changes.</p><p>One difficulty with many of the studies that address this question is the problem of reverse causality. Changes in personality may drive social role changes rather than the other way around.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8.C. External Changes to Biology</head><p>The previous subsection discusses the difficulty in disentangling biological changes in personality from environmental or situational effects. In this subsection we provide some evidence on causal changes in personality due to external forces that either damage parts of the brain or abruptly alter the chemistry of the brain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brain Lesion Studies</head><p>Brain lesion studies provide the most dramatic and convincing evidence that personality can change. The most famous example is Phineas Gage, a construction foreman whose head was impaled by a metal spike and who subsequently changed from being polite and dependable to rude and unreliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Damasio, Grabowski, Frank et al. [2005]</ref>). Since then, there have been many more case studies of patients with brain damage. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b350">Mataró, Jurado, García-Sánchez et al. [2001]</ref> describe the behavior of a Spanish patient whose head was impaled by an iron spike, injuring both frontal lobes. Like Phineas Gage, his behavior changed. After the accident, he had difficulty planning, became more irritable, and had problems regulating emotions. Unlike Phineas, he was cheerful and did not display anti-social behavior, suggesting the personality is malleable in different dimensions, even through brain damage.</p><p>The effects of brain damage are persistent. After five years, patients who suffered traumatic head injuries have social impairments, such as anger control, even when their performance on cognitive tasks returns to the normal range <ref type="bibr" target="#b330">(Lezak [1987]</ref>).</p><p>Using more advanced methods, neuroscientists have delved deeper into the inner workings of the brain. Some recent studies have investigated how two parts of the brain, the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), affect personality by regulating emotion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Bechara [2005]</ref> discusses how emotion might allow people to assign and store value to particular outcomes in a way that is useful for decision-making. The amygdala is thought to signal "impulsive" emotional responses to immediate environmental stimuli, such as reacting quickly to a snake. In contrast, the VMPC is thought to signal "reflective" emotional responses to memories and knowledge. These two parts of the brain conflict with each other when people make decisions: signals from the amygdala induce behavior that implicitly values immediate outcomes, whereas signals from the VMPC reflect long-run considerations. The stronger signal dictates the resultant behavior. People with damage to these parts of the brain, exhibit changes in personality. For example, people with damage to the VMPC, the part that regulates reflective emotion, tend to act impulsively and seem to overvalue short-term outcomes in a way that leads to long-term financial loss and loss of friendships, despite having relatively normal levels of intellectual capacity. These findings are consistent with McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, and</p><p>Cohen's    system that describes hyperbolic discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b359">(McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein et al. [2004]</ref>). However, some recent research in neuroscience challenges this theory and presents empirical evidence that contradicts    theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b387">(Monterosso and Luo [2010]</ref>).</p><p>Further experiments involving these parts of the brain highlight why attempts to separate cognitive and noncognitive traits might be futile. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Bechara and Damasio [2005]</ref> study the performance of patients with lesions in the VMPC in a seemingly cognitive task. The participants were given the Iowa Gambling Task, in which they repeatedly chose between four decks of cards that represented lotteries of different value, unknown to the participant at the onset. Throughout the experiment, the authors also measured skin conductance responses (SCRs), a known physiological reflection of emotion. By trial and error, participants without lesions learned to choose the "better" decks of cards with lower short-term payoffs but higher average payoffs. The normal participants also showed emotional activity both when picking their card and when receiving the rewards or penalties. In contrast, people with lesions never learned to pick the better decks, seemingly because they could not develop emotional responses. Patients with damage to the amygdala never showed emotional response to rewards or penalties, suggesting they never learned to value the outcomes at all. Patients with damage to the VMPC showed emotional response only when receiving the reward or penalty but not when selecting decks, suggesting that they might not have reflective emotional responses crucial in considering future consequences. The findings suggest that emotion helps to guide decision-making.</p><p>Numerous other studies show the role of the amygdala in signaling emotions and its relationship to cognition and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b415">(Phelps [2006]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemical and Laboratory Interventions</head><p>A few recent studies show that it is possible to alter preferences and personality through experiments that change the brain's chemistry.

Similarly, nasal sprays of oxytocin increase trust (distinct from altruism or ability to assess probabilities) in a game-theoretic experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">(Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak et al.

The Effects of Schooling on Cognitive and Personality Traits</head><p>Despite a large literature on the effects of schooling on shaping preferences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Bowles and Gintis [1976]</ref> and the literature it spawned), there is surprisingly little direct evidence on the effect of schooling on cognitive and personality traits. An exception is the analysis of Heckman, Stixrud and <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">Urzua [2006]</ref>. The authors formulate and estimate an economic model that identifies the effect of cognitive and personality traits on schooling and a variety of other outcomes. The model controls for the effect of schooling in boosting both cognitive and personality measures and thus controls for reverse causality. They estimate their model on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), which has measures on the components of the Armed Services Vocational Battery (ASVAB) that are used to create the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT), a widely used measure of cognition. In addition, the NLSY79 has two measures of personality.</p><p>The Rotter Locus of Control Scale, discussed in Section 5, is designed to capture the extent to which individuals believe that they have control over their lives through self-motivation or selfdetermination as opposed to the extent that the environment controls their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b461">(Rotter [1966]</ref>).</p><p>The NLSY79 data also contain the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, which attempts to assess the degree of approval or disapproval of one's self <ref type="bibr" target="#b456">(Rosenberg [1965]</ref>).

Schooling in the high school years has moderate but positive effects on the measures of cognition, consistent with previous research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b396">Neal and Johnson [1996]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b560">Winship and Korenman [1997]</ref>. The most dramatic causal effects on cognition arise from college attendance. In contrast, locus of control is primarily affected by high school attendance but not college attendance. On measures of self-esteem, an additional year of high school and college play powerful roles. 232 Notes: Effect of schooling on socioemotional scales for males with average ability, with 95% confidence bands. The locus of control scale is based on the four-item abbreviated version of the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale. This scale is designed to measure the extent to which individuals believe that they have control over their lives through self-motivation or self-determination (internal control) as opposed to the extent to which individuals believe that the environment controls their lives (external control). The self-esteem scale is based on the 10-item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. This scale describes a degree of approval or disapproval toward oneself. In both cases, we standardize the test scores to have within-sample mean zero and variance one, after taking averages over the respective sets of scales. The model is estimated using the NLSY79 sample. Solid lines depict average test scores, and dashed lines, 2.5%-97.5% confidence intervals.

This evidence is consistent with the discussions in Sections 5 and 7 that show that achievement test results are strongly dependent on personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008]</ref>; Borghans, Golsteyn, <ref type="bibr">Heckman et al. [2009]</ref>). Indeed the personalities of participants improved. Participants had better direct measures of personal behavior (a weighted average of "absences and truancies," "lying and cheating," "stealing," and "swears or uses obscene words" measured by teachers in the elementary school years). Participants improved their internalizing behavior, which, as noted in Section 5, is related to Neuroticism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]</ref> decompose the treatment effects of the Perry Program into components due to experientially-induced changes of cognition (IQ) and the measures of personality at their disposal, and to residual factors.</p><p>Personality played a more important role in outcomes, particularly in later life. Analyses of data from Project STAR, a program that randomly assigned kindergarteners and teachers to classes of different sizes, yields similar results to the Perry Program. Using data from Project STAR, <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Dee and West [2008]</ref> find that assignment to a small class is associated with positive changes in personality. In a follow-up reanalysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Chetty, Friedman, Hilger et al. [2010]</ref> examine the Project STAR program and find that students placed in higher quality kindergarten classes-as measured by their peer's average performance on a Stanford Achievement Testtend to have higher test scores at the end of kindergarten. The effect fades out over time; by eighth grade, students in better kindergarten classes perform no differently on tests. However, as with the Perry Program, the benefits reemerge later in life. People in better kindergarten classrooms had significantly higher earnings in early adulthood. Furthermore, kindergarten classroom quality also predicted better fourth and eighth grade behavior as measured by teacher-Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 201 assessed effort, initiative, interest in the class, and disruptive behavior. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_77">235</ref> In turn, behavior predicted earnings in adulthood, suggesting that personality is the channel through which better kindergarten classrooms improve earnings.</p><p>The Perry Program and Project STAR did not primarily focus on improving personality traits, but a few programs have. The Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum teaches self-control, emotional awareness, and social problem-solving skills and is aimed at elementary school children (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Bierman, Coie, Dodge et al. [2010]</ref>). A recent randomassignment, longitudinal study demonstrates that the PATHS curriculum reduces teacher and peer ratings of aggression, improves teacher and peer ratings of prosocial behavior, and improves teacher ratings of academic engagement. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_78">236</ref> PATHS is an exemplar of school-based social and emotional learning (SEL) programs, whose impact on both course grades ( 0.33 d </p><p>), where d is measured in units of standard deviations ("effect sizes"), and standardized achievement tests scores ( 0.27 d </p><p>), was recently documented in a meta-analysis of controlled studies involving over 270,000 children in kindergarten through college <ref type="bibr">(Durlak and Weissberg [in press]</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_79">237</ref>Likewise, a random assignment evaluation of Tools of the Mind, a preschool and early primary school curriculum, shows that in short-term follow-ups it improves classroom behavior as well as executive function, defined as higher-level cognitive skills including inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Barnett, Jung, Yarosz et al. [2008]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Barnett, Yarosz, Thomas et al. [2006]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Bodrova and Leong [2001]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Bodrova and Leong [2007]</ref>; Diamond, <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Barnett, Thomas et al. [2007]</ref>). Similar findings are reported for the Montessori preschool curriculum <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">(Lillard and Else-Quest [2006]</ref>).</p><p>There is also evidence that targeted intervention efforts delivered to individual children can improve aspects of Conscientiousness. These studies are typically more short-term and, in contrast to the multi-faceted curricula described above, are designed to isolate a particular mechanism for behavior change. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Rueda and colleagues [2005]</ref> designed a set of computer exercises to train attention in children between four and six years of age. Children in the intervention group improved in performance on computer tasks of attention relative to children who instead watched interactive videos for a comparable amount of time. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">Stevens and colleagues [2008]</ref> designed a six-week computerized intervention and showed that it can improve selective auditory attention (i.e., the ability to attend to a target auditory signal in the face of an irrelevant, distracting auditory signal). Again, all of these programs have shortterm follow-ups.</p><p>Several studies suggest that personality can be remediated in adolescence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">Martins [2010]</ref> analyzes data from EPSIS, a program developed to improve student achievement of 13-15 yearolds in Portugal by increasing motivation, self-esteem, and study skills. The program consists of one-on-one meetings with a trained staff member or meetings in small groups. 12% more likely to obtain a high school diploma or GED, were 9% more likely to be working full time, and were less likely to be arrested. Furthermore, participants had higher levels of selfefficacy (a trait related to Emotional Stability), suggesting that personality change might have helped with the improvements. However, the 9-month follow-up period is too short to know if the program has long-lasting effects. While these studies show that personality can be improved through intervention, a couple of other studies show less promising results when the interventions were targeted at adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b455">(Rodríguez-Planas [2010]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Holmlund and Silva [2009]</ref>).</p><p>Behncke <ref type="bibr">[2009]</ref> provides some experimental evidence that short-term exogenous shocks to non-cognitive skills affect test performance. She finds giving words of encouragement, an intervention that might boost short-term self-efficacy or self-esteem, before a diagnostic math test was associated with 2.5% higher scores amongst all students ( 0.05) p  and 8% higher scores amongst those with self-reported difficulties with math ( 0.01) p </p><p>. The result suggests that non-cognitive skills can be shaped, even in the very short-term.</p><p>The evidence for adults corroborates the finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010]</ref> for children. Personality is malleable throughout the life cycle. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Gottschalk [2005]</ref> shows evidence from a randomized control trial that working at a job can improve locus of control. He uses data from the Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) in which some welfare recipients were randomly offered substantial subsidies to work. The subsidy more than doubled the earnings of a minimum wage worker, and people in the experiment group worked about 1/3 more hours than those in the control group. After 36 months, those who received the subsidy were more likely to have an improved locus of control.</p><p>Almlund, <ref type="bibr">Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 2/4/2011 204</ref> Several other studies find similar results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Clausen and Gilens [1990]</ref> claim that female labor force participation increases self-confidence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b435">Roberts [1997]</ref> reports an increase of social dominance and <ref type="bibr" target="#b439">Roberts and Chapman [2000]</ref> a decrease in Neuroticism for working women.</p><p>Others show that marital and family experiences shape personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">(Helson and Picano [1990]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b443">Roberts, Helson and Klohnen [2002]</ref>). However, these studies are all correlational in nature.</p><p>None of these studies have the random assignment features of the Gottschalk study.</p><p>Personality may even be malleable at the end of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">Jackson, Hill, Payne et al. [2010]</ref> investigate causal mechanisms behind the association between Openness to Experience and IQ, using data from a 16-week intervention designed to boost inductive reasoning for elderly people.</p><p>The intervention consisted of lab training for how to recognize novel patterns and around 10 hours a week of solving crossword, Sudoku, and logic puzzles. Controlling for inductive reasoning, self-reported Openness to Experience increased for participants during the training program relative to those in a waitlisted control group. However, the elderly people were not followed after the program to determine whether the change was long-lasting nor were other important outcomes, like life expectancy, tracked.  Verbal encouragement raised test scores by 2.5% amongst all students (p&lt;0.05) and by 8.0% amongst students who reported difficulties with math (p&lt;0.01). Post treatment -Behavioral measures were taken again in the spring of 3 rd grade around the end of the program.</p><p>Immediately after the 3-year program, participation was associated with a 0.24 standard deviation increase in authority acceptance (p&lt;0.001), a 0.12 standard deviation increase in cognitive concentration (p&lt;0.001), and a 0.34 standard deviation increase in social competence (p&lt;0.0001) compared to the control group. The effects were stronger in more disadvantaged schools. Similar but weaker results apply for the peerassessed measures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence from Psychotherapy</head><p>The accomplishments of psychotherapy also support the possibility of intentional, mean-level, and rank-order change. In a 1980 meta-analysis, Smith, Glass and Miller summarized 475 controlled studies, concluding that individuals who undergo psychotherapy are about 0.85 standard deviations better on outcome measures than those who do not. The large benefits of therapy are not permanent, however: the effect of psychotherapy over control conditions falls to about half a standard deviation two years after therapy is concluded. Moreover, it is not clear that the effects of psychotherapy on individuals who seek change generalize to individuals who are not actively seeking treatment for a condition that causes them distress. 238   More evidence on the possibility of intentional change comes from the psychological literature on expertise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Ericsson, Krampe and Tesch-Römer [1993]</ref> demonstrate across domains as diverse as chess, musical performance, and digit span memory, that thousands of hours of sustained, deliberate practice lead to dramatic improvements in skill.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>We summarize this chapter by providing provisional answers to the eight questions posed in Section 1.</p><p>(1) How can we fit psychological constructs of personality into an economic framework?</p><p>Can conventional models of preferences in economics characterize the main theories in personality psychology?</p><p>We have defined personality as a response function of agents that depends on situations (including incentives), endowments of traits, information, and resources within a conventional economic model. Psychologists analyze a richer class of actions than economists normally consider. We show how to integrate these actions into economic theory. The leading models of personality psychology are special cases of our model. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_81">240</ref>(2) What are the main measurement systems used in psychology for representing personality and personality traits, and how are they validated? How are different systems related to each other? What is the relationship between standard measures of personality and measures of psychopathology and child temperament?</p><p>In Section 5, we exposit the main systems for measuring personality, focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on the Big Five model. We consider the strengths and limitations of the systems and the relationships among competing systems. We show how measures of psychopathology are extreme manifestations of personality traits and how child temperament is related to adult traits. We link specific diagnoses of pathology with conventional measures of psychological traits.</p><p>(3) What is the relationship between economic preference parameters and psychological measurements?</p><p>We review an emerging body of research that relates economic preference parameters (risk aversion, time preference, ambiguity aversion, social preferences) to the Big Five traits and to measures of self-esteem and personal control that are linked to the Big Five traits. Time preference is negatively correlated with IQ and the ability to control attention. Risk preference is negatively correlated with IQ and other measures of cognition. Higher IQ people are more consistent in their choices under uncertainty.</p><p>While risk aversion is related to personality traits, the available evidence suggests that marginal ambiguity aversion is not. Social preferences are predicted by measured personality traits, but the evidence on this question is not strong.</p><p>(4) How stable across situations and over the life cycle are preference parameters and personality traits?</p><p>We review the history of the person-situation debate between the social psychologists who maintain the primacy of the situation in determining behavior and the traits theorists who maintain the primacy of traits in explaining behavior. Behavioral economists, as a group, have adopted the situationist point of view. Extreme advocates of the situationist point of view claim that there is no personality construct. The issue hinges on the nonlinearity of action, effort, and productivity functions. In the presence of such nonlinearities, measured traits (e.g., actions) depend on situations and tasks.</p><p>A large body of evidence suggests that nonlinearity is an empirically important phenomenon. Nonetheless, a large body of evidence suggests that there are stable personality traits that predict a variety of behaviors in different situations. Personality is not an ephemeral creation of situations, nor is its manifestation invariant across situations. Moreover, personality traits are not set in stone. They change over the life cycle. The evidence on the stability of preference parameters across situations and over life cycle is less ample. There is evidence that standard separable models of preferences are inadequate descriptions of choice behavior. There is little evidence on the stability or instability of preference parameters over the life cycle.</p><p>(5) What is the evidence on the predictive power of cognitive and personality traits?</p><p>We present a large body of evidence that shows strong associations between personality traits and educational, labor market, health, and criminal outcomes. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) What is the evidence on the causal power of personality on behavioral outcomes? Few of the correlational studies relating personality to outcomes have a firm causal basis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personality psychologists do not yet attempt to establish the causal status of personality.</head><p>There are, however, a few experimental manipulations that establish the causal effect of personality. Recent studies in economics establish causal status of certain personality traits on outcomes for observational studies invoking assumptions that are inevitably subject to debate. Research in this area is likely to flourish in the coming years.</p><p>(7) Can personality be altered across the life cycle? Are interventions that change personality traits likely fruitful avenues for policy?</p><p>There is a small but growing body of intervention studies that establish that personality traits can be altered over long periods of time in response to interventions. Some of the major effects of early childhood intervention programs appear to operate through their lasting effects on personality. Family investment decisions also change personality. The evidence to date suggests that interventions that boost personality traits can be effective in promoting adult success.</p><p>(8) Do the findings from psychology suggest that conventional economic theory should be enriched?</p><p>The evidence from psychology enriches economics by providing a more nuanced interpretation of human choice and actions. It promises to provide a deeper understanding of conventional economic preference parameters and how they arise.</p><p>Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, this promise remains unfulfilled. Given the current state of evidence against conventional economic preference specifications (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b513">Starmer [2000]</ref> and the evidence in Section 6), this line of research is very promising.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Three competing visions of the source of change are discussed: (a) The ontogenic and sociogenic model that describes how biology and socialization produce changes in average traits. This approach does not explain why individuals develop with different trajectories; (b) The biological and pharmacological model that describes how alterations in the biology of the person can explain variations in personality and its evolution; and (c) The intervention/family influence model that describes how investment and environments influence changes. No study considers all three sources of development at the same time, largely due to data limitations. The evidence from the intervention and family influence studies suggests that interventions that target personality may be effective but much further evidence is required to specify the exact mechanisms through which the interventions work.</figDesc></figure>

Known as the Stanford-Binet IQ test, Terman's adaptation was, like the original French test, used primarily to predict academic performance.

Second, the ratio of mental to chronological age was an inappropriate metric for adults</p><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Boake [2002]</ref></p>). Wechsler created a new intelligence test battery divided into verbal subtests (e.g., similarities) and performance subtests (e.g., block design, matrix reasoning). He also replaced the ratio IQ score with deviation scores that have the same normal distribution at each age. This test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-and, later, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-produces two different IQ subscores, verbal IQ and performance IQ, which sum to a full-scale IQ score. The WAIS and the WISC have for the past several decades been by far the most commonly used IQ tests.</p>Similar to Wechsler's Matrix Reasoning subtest, the Raven Progressive Matrices test is a so-called "culture-free" IQ test because it does not depend heavily on verbal skills or other knowledge explicitly taught during formal education. Each matrix test item presents a pattern of abstract figures.</p>137 </p>The test taker must choose the missing part.</p>138 </p>If subjects have not had exposure to such visual puzzles, the Raven test is an almost pure measure of fluid intelligence.</p></note></figure>

Background variables include race and sex dummies, mother's highest grade completed, father's highest grade completed, southern residence at age 14, urban residence at age 14, living in a broken home at age 14, receiving newspapers in the household at age 14, receiving magazines in the household at age 14, and the household having a library card at age 14.

Similarly, Figure15shows that in samples from three New York City middle schools, controlling for IQ, Openness to Experience is associated with Standardized Achievement Test Scores. Figure 15.

            <note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="141" xml:id="foot_30"><p>Indeed, some psychologists use the term "temperament" to indicate all aspects of personality that are biological in origin. They study temperament in both children and adults.</p></note>
            <note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="142" xml:id="foot_31"><p>Measuring temperament presents unique methodological challenges. Self-report measures, by far the most widely used measure for adult personality, are not appropriate for young children for obvious reasons. One strategy is to ask parents and teachers to rate the child's overt behavior (for example, California Child Q-sort), but informants can only guess what a child might be thinking and feeling. Infants present a special challenge because their behavioral repertoire is so limited. One strategy is to place infants in a standard situation and code reactions under a standardized scenario (for example, the Strange Situation, which is used to distinguish infants who are securely attached to their caregiver versus insecurely attached). Young children can be interviewed using puppets or stories. For obvious reasons, all measures of temperament are more difficult and more expensive to collect than adult selfreport measures. This may explain the absence of large-sample studies of child temperament.</p></note>

It explains why investments in disadvantaged young children are so productive. (See <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">Knudsen, Heckman, Cameron et al. [2006]</ref>.) Early investments enhance the productivity of later investments. Dynamic complementarity also explains why investment in low ability adults often has such low returns-because the stock of v  is low. 225   Using dynamic complementarity, one can define critical and sensitive periods for investment. 226 The technology of skill formation is consistent with a body of evidence that shows critical and sensitive periods in human development for a variety of traits. 227   Figure <ref type="figure">28</ref> shows how adult outcomes are shaped by sequences of investments over the life cycle. The importance of the early years depends on how easy it is to reverse adverse early effects with later investment. The literature shows that resilience and remediation are possible, but are more costly later on. 228 The accumulation of investments over the life cycle of the child determines adult outcomes and the choices people will make when they become adults. To capture these interactive effects requires nonlinear models.</p><p>For the purposes of policy analysis, it is important to know at which stage of the life cycle interventions are the most effective and to move beyond the correlations between early life and later life events to understand the mechanisms of skill formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Cunha and Heckman [2008]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010]</ref> estimate technologies of skill formation to Some other evidence supports the possibility that school can affect measures of intelligence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Cahan and Cohen [1989]</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b485">(Schooler, Mulatu and Oates [1999]</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">Kohn and Schooler [1978]</ref>).</p></div>

In addition, there were home visits to promote parent-child interactions. The program stopped after two years. Participants were taught social skills in a "plan-do-review" sequence where students planned a task, executed it and then reviewed it with teachers and fellow students. They learned to work with others when problems arose. 233 The program was evaluated by the method of random assignment. The mean difference in standard deviations between the treatment and control groups are as follows: social and emotional learning skills = 0.57 (p&lt;0.05); attitudes = 0.23 (p&lt;0.05); positive social behavior = 0.24 (p&lt;0.05); conduct problems = 0.22 (p&lt;0.05); emotional distress = 0.24 (p&lt;0.05); academic performance = 0.27 (p&lt;0.05).
